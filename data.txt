"Great little treadmill for me to keep moving while I work on my laptop as I work from home. Amazingly great price -even other cheapie treadmills cost 2x3 times and good ones cost 5-10x more. Very quiet too, doesn't freak out the cats. The incline is a little steep which makes it easy to move too fast so I just raised the back a couple inches with some wood slabs (see photo).
So much better for my posture and sense of well being to walk a few hours a day on this instead of just sitting all the time!"
"Update 2/14/2020 - still amazing, still working perfectly and effective. I love my manual treadmill! For myself and for my online training clients! I add a weighted vest and weighted resistance band for added strengthening and toning referenced in The picture of bright shorts and pink vest
This was really more than I expected. I love ur for many reasons. It's manual and I love that. The belt only moves when you make the effort. It's really sturdy and not cheap feeling. I can't wait to post a 90 day quarantine look for my walking plan on my Sunny Health Manual Treadmill. I am an online trainer and I recommended it to several clients who also love it. Other trainers are also reaching out after I posted a full video of my slooowww assembly. Lol! I would love someone to put it together for me - but I'm socially distancing and honestly just trying to save money. Great experience knowing I of all people can put together a whole treadmill. That was a confidence booster! But it is a phenomenal piece of investment into my own health which is essential to me. Pardon the pom poms - I'm a former cheerleader but I still love and use them. Got my heart rate on my Apple Watch average 148 bpm!!! Not a lot of calories but that's because my body is in great shape so my heart is more efficient and doesn't work as hard, so I'll always have lower calories. But still - it was a good challenge for me!"
"This little bugger is a lot of fun. My grandkids love to get on it and see how fast they can get it to go. It's a little bit of a challenge for them to get it started sometimes, but not impossible, even for the almost 4 year old. Yes, it catches a bit when starting it up, but it has to have some resistance, otherwise it wouldn't work. It's SO light! It's very easy to move around the living-room, so it gets used a LOT more that way.
I bought it to be able to put under my desk, thinking I could use it without the handles, but you have to hold onto it because of the mandatory incline of the tread. I did get it rigged up to use with my laptop though. It's a little distracting, but definitely doable.
There is only a slight incline to the handlebars, and I just happened to have the perfect piece of wood to place over the bars. It's 15""x23"" and leaves just enough room for my hands to hold onto the bars, and the laptop stays on it pretty securely with its rubber feet. The piece of wood has a small strip of wood on the back that hangs over the back part of the bar to hold it in place. I have to slide off the counter to do that.
Now, I have to admit, It is still virtually impossible to actually WORK on the laptop without one more adaptation. You have to hold on, because of the tread incline, so I pulled out a couple of old shoulder straps and wrapped them around the vertical bars and my waist, so I could walk without holding on.
That may sound like a lot of hassle to some, but the super light-weight ease of moving this thing around makes it all worth it. I have to clear out my living room twice a week for a movement class, and it's NO problem with this. Best of all, I don't have to be tethered, staring at a wall when using it!!!
I weigh about 150#, it seems very sturdy, and I don't have any problem with slippage or crooked tread. There's not much that can go wrong with this thing, so I'm looking forward to many years of use, for comparatively next to nothing in price.
I have a large 300# capable beast in my bedroom, and now I don't have to go hide out in there to get my exercise. Nor do I have to hurt my back taking that tread up and down."
"Great value. I read many of the reviews before I purchased this.
It gets you up to a sweat as all the energy to make it go comes from the person on it.
This has become a habit for me though many times I dread it. But even on those days I'll slog along for 40-50 minutes and regardless of my plodding have killed over 200 calories and ""walked"" 2 miles.
Something is happening. I feel better. My posture has improved. Too old to think I'll ever have ""buns of steel"" again, but, as far as a mood elevator, this thing provides enough effort to get those endorphins flowing after 12 minutes.
Easy to assemble. Take your time. Sunny supplies tools with the treadmill, which is a nice plus. But I found using my own was easier.
It's not that heavy unless you are really old or have zero upper body strength.
Not that compact when folded up, as the feet of it stick out.
Cons: Incline is very steep, especially for beginners [as I was] or the elderly [as I am ] or both. If you get on it, be prepared to hold on to the handle bars as it will get away with you and you could very likely land on your face with a treadmill belt impression in your wrinkly old forehead. Laugh, yes. But heed my warning.
I use a pair of old hard back books for right now to raise it up for a more moderate incline.
Objective is to use nothing to raise it. Must have goals even at this age.
The little wheels that move it when folded should be larger. I've scratched my flooring with the frame of the thing trying to move it to where I store it.
It burns calories, requires real effort and some days I hate it just for existing. But it sure does feel good afterward.
Just set it up and get on it. Project your mind somewhere else. Don't look at the digital read out and before you know it that critical 12 minutes* to get yourself ""in the groove "" [OMG the '60s live !] will have passed. Start with 15. Then 20. Soon you will want to do more just because you feel so good afterward.
I am very pleased. And just got off it actually: 50 minutes, 248 calories burned. 2 miles walked. And I was NOT into it today, just a slog at 2.4-2.7 mph. I have actually jogged for a short while
* See Covert Bailey's ""Fit Or Fat"" . This is where I got my information on aerobic exercise and what happens to the body while engaging in it. It's old but it may be available on Amazon still."
"First, it was easy to unbox, easy to assemble by myself (I'm a weak 52 yr old woman), and I was using it within 30 minutes.
Second, please realize this is a very basic treadmill. It goes only when you make it go. But if that is what you want, this is a good one.
Now here a few tips. The incline is not adjustable so I put a small block of wood under the back end so it would be a little easier. It's pretty intense with the standard incline. The display shows everything you need, distance, speed, calories burned, time.
I can't run or walk on it without holding on to the bars so I rigged up a belt as someone else had suggested and it works great.
It works best with shoes because they grip the belt and help you move it.
It's quiet, easy to move around and a good value."
Worse purchase I ever made on Amazon! I was excited about it initially, because it appeared to be the solution to buying a used treadmill on Facebook marketplace for my budget. I am 35 years old and not too overweight, but I guess I'm too out of shape for this treadmill to work for me. I cannot walk on it without literally holding myself up by the handlebars. I know I'm out of shape, but not that out of shape! The (what appears to me as a 20 degree ) FIXED incline should qualify it to be listed under stairclimbers or strength training, rather than cardio. I'm not usually the type to send stuff back, but it's that useless to me right now.
"This treadmill works pretty well for me.
I'm 6 ft tall.
I was 200 lbs when I started using this a few weeks ago
Changed my diet and started using this in 20 minute bursts and now I'm 193 lbs.
The incline isn't adjustable but I didn't find it a bad incline.
I was able to run on this with socks just fine (I didn't want to dirty the belt with my shoes)
It's not possible to run on this without holding the handles (you will slip off no matter how fast you run)
To control your pace you have to adjust how much strength you put into holding the handles.
It doesn't take much to maintain a walking pace. And standing stationary isn't difficult either.
The belt is lubricated underneath. It comes with lube so you can lubricate it more if needed.
The treadmill is a little hard to move. You have to sorta pick it up on one end. It has wheels but they aren't great."
As depicted. Assembly simple in concept, but a bit difficult in execution All parts fit together well. Operation is good. One small problem: when folded, it is diagonally unstable. Instructions do not provide solution. There are solutions, but they don't fit my problem. A little difficult to learn to use it, but I am quite pleased with the item, as is my spouse. I recommend it to anyone wanting an inexpensive but very useful treadmill.
"Wow! This treadmill is absolutely fantastic!!
1) It shipped two days early which is huge.
2) The instructions were super straight forward and it was easy to assemble.
3) It's SO much fun!
I've used a manual treadmill in the past, and this one makes it so easy to keep a consistent pace. The incline helps a lot, and also makes walks/runs a little more effective. Background on me: I'm in my mid 20s, ran track and cross country in high school, and ran half marathons in college. Unfortunately my knees are a mess from years of running. This machine provides a solid work out, but is still gentle on my knees. Honestly, this is a great deal!"
Have had the treadmill for over a year now and it is still a great little treadmill for walking! Updated from 5 to 4 stars due to having some issues aligning belt duw to faulty instructions. Notice it says to adjust belt in same way regardless of the belt moves left or right. Note the updates (in the circled area) that I had to make to align the belt back to the middle when it moved to the left. It was easy to assemble and is easy to fold up/unfold. Not too noisy, lightweight, and size is great for keeping in TV room. Have to increase my work out time little by little due to the higher incline. My use is mainly for cardio walking and handle bars are good fit for my height of 5'6". May not be good fit for running as belt goes really fast. So far it's been a great value for the price paid.
this is not what i was waiting for. it is not easy to use. i wanted to walk and talk on the phone and sometimes chat, but you must put your hands on the bars, otherwise you will jump out from this thing. for me it is unconfortable. just ond thing what i like, it does not take a lot of space from my room. but thinking to return
Omg I just hate this treadmill manual it suck, where do i start the incline is too high it, impossible to use at a comfortable pace my hips and back hurt after using it i was forcing myself to like it because i didn't want to go through the mailing back process but i dont see myself using it every day i typically walk 2 hours in the morning before work from Monday to Friday this machine is not that difficult to assembly it time consuming but come with everything you need i just dislike the inclination the noisy belt and the discomfort cause to my lower back and hips. customers be aware of it before ordering it that being said the material is not that bad the small belt is not issue but i am returning it.
"This is a great treadmill for the price. Gives me a decent workout, especially with the incline. I wrapped a resistance band around the handles and by holding on to that instead of the handles, my fitbit captures the steps.
Definitely have to hold on to something though, this thing gets moving if not. Can use for a nice walk or slow jog. Surface is too small for a fast paced run."
When COVID-19 hit, I couldn't go to the gym anymore. When the months rolled by, I realized I'd never be comfortable going back with my current health issues, so I purchased this treadmill specifically because it's small and foldable, and also because it's a manual treadmill. I had no idea how much better of a workout I would get on this little manual treadmill compared to the big, expensive motorized ones at the gym. Since there's no motor, you have to push the belt yourself, rather than just keep up with a belt that moves itself. It has worked out my legs and glutes much better, and the cardio benefits are far superior to the motorized treadmills I was used to. Please note that I am a small person, 5'1" and this treadmill fits my frame comfortably but I think a person with a large frame might not be best served by this model. Please note any weight limits in the description -- the user manual I received references a maximum weight of 220 pounds.
"This is the third item by Sunny that we own. I have their stationary bike, their rowing machine and now this great treadmill. I suspect that a few of the negative reviews were from people who did not fully read the instructions. We did find that we needed a mat (also by Sunny) for the rowing machine as it would slide on our wood floors when my husband or son used it. This in no way is a negative of the product. I do not need a mat for this treadmill or the bike.
The tension can be adjusted if needed on the treadmill. Read the instructions :) It was very easy to put together. I did need my husbands help for like one minute. That was to attach the running board to the bars to support the hand rail. I just needed him to hold it up for me for a minute while I put the bolts in. I probably ould have done it myself if I had to. It runs very smoothly and I do not see why someone would need to even get a electronic one. Which I have used many times but I find this to work just as well. It also arrived a day early!"
"This is a great little treadmill! I purchased this for my wife as she used to have a manual treadmill in the past. This item has exceeded my expectations. First of all, this is a manual treadmill meaning there is no motor. You are the motor! Manual treadmills provide a great workout as you are required to keep the belt moving. This leads to improved balance, strength and a more true cardio effort vs a motorized mill where you are just picking up your feet in response to a moving belt.
The pros: its never in the way! It folds up nicely and when its set up, its still not in the way. Big plus if you are short on space. This thing will fit anywhere. Quality construction! I was impressed with the quality of materials used on this product. Nothing felt cheap and very easy to assemble. Smooth quiet operation of the belt and no squeaking or rattling when walking or running.
The cons: the treadmill comes with a fixed angle of 13 degrees. This is a bit steep even for accomplished athletes. I had to put 2 2x4 studs under the rear deck to take the angle down. This is the solution to this problem and works well. I can adjust the angle simply by switching the 2x4`s out. Sunny health and fitness needs to make this treadmill adjustable this way and it would be perfect. The LCD display is hard to read, but that's by no means a deal breaker.
Overall, I'm very happy with this unit and highly recommend it. The price point is right on and users will find this a great addition to their fitness goal."
Although some folks might think but you cannot control the speed you actually can't. It all depends on where you choose to walk if you walk in the center he goes faster but if you start walking from the top it slows down. It's not fancy but it does the job
This treadmill is great. I just used it and decided to write this! Sure, it isn't some high end machine you'd use at the gym, but it is perfect for those of us who need something small at home that gets a good workout. I wear my Fitbit while walking fast and my HR can go up to 155 easily and I'm in decent shape. When COVID happened I ditched my $25/mo gym membership and got this for $150 which is about $12.50 per month for a year. Worth it! The only negatives have been that the wheel cover on the front was cracked when it arrived, but the company sent me a new one. It was just a cosmetic thing anyway. Second thing is that the belt is difficult to get perfectly centered. It is still perfectly functional but looks off center. Other than those two things it is great. Get you a tablet/phone mount on the handle bars and watch shows while walking! Hope this helps!
"I just watched my son put this together but I will do the walking myself. Looks like a very nice piece of equipment...well
made. Sunnie"
I 100% regret buying this treadmill. Lots of the reviews say you have to hold on to use this either walking or 'light jog' which is completely true. I jog consistently but thought that even if I could use this to walk since I work at home, it would be worth the price. I get that it's manual so that is probably why there is an incline but the incline is too much, in my opinion. Gradual walking is not an option for this thing. Running- not an option unless you enjoy holding onto the railings. Plus- Super easy to put together. Literally took me maybe 15 minutes. Portable. Easy to fold up, easy to move. Since I tossed the box I am going to try to re-sell it on my own to recover a little bit of money from it. I wish I would have spent an extra $100 and just got the motorized treadmill. If you want to hang on for your life while attempting to walk,this is for you. Otherwise, spend a little more money and get something that is more useful and you can walk flat instead of constantly up a hill.
I walk at a pretty fast pace daily on it, and it's everything I hoped for! You do have to wear shoes on it, but thats not a problem. The belt tends to gradually move slightly off to the left, but that's just a matter of finding the right adjustment of the bolts to prevent that. I was worried that it would take a lot of force to move the belt, since it's a manual, but it doesn't. It's just like walking up a small hill, since I have it set to the highest angle. Just get ready to sweat! I would have liked the instructions to be a bit more detailed, but I assembled it myself within a couple hours, and it was fairly easy. It's best to have help though, because the thing is heavy! Everything works properly on it. Well worth the money! It is a little noisy, but not bad. I like to watch tv while I walk, and I can hear my tv over it fine. I love it!
"I put off assembling for several days, figuring it would be a PITA...but it was surprisingly easy. Instructions are clear, components specific to left and right sides marked, all hardware identified for which part and section of treadmill identified.
The instructions say to use 2 people for the heavy parts (attaching the treadmill to the stand) , but you can do this alone by using one of the packaging 5"" x 21"" styro end pieces to prop the front end up while you bolt it in :).
I found attaching the first four bolts with the wrench tool in part one the fiddliest, and used a ratchet with a 13mm socket and it went much faster.
I haven't tried the LED yet, need batteries, but the treadmill works great, am very pleased with it (and myself ðŸ¤£). Recommend!"
"I was hesitant about this purchase due to my lack of experience using manual treadmills and the somewhat bifurcated reviews online. So I've decided to write a pretty detailed one here myself. Hopefully it'll help you decide if this is for you :)
If you're counting on returning it if you don't like it... forget it. It's pretty heavy - I cannot carry it all on my own. It took me a full hour to assemble (and I have a bachelor's degree in engineering so not a mechanics idiot). By the time I pushed it to my apartment, spent an hour in a squat position to tighten all kinds of screws, and finally had it set up... I barely had energy to use it, not to even think about returning it...
When assembling, be sure to read the instructions very carefully because you can easily get the vertical side bars facing the wrong way or make some other mistakes, and it'd be tough to correct them later after you've installed some other parts.
You do need help from 1 more person with moving it + assembling it. So pls make sure there's someone at home ready to help you.
Once all set up, I actually quite like it. The treading belt is pretty narrow, however being a medium sized girl I find it pretty comfortable to walk on. It's completely enough for me and I don't need to pay attention when I'm walking. But if you're a big guy who's used to electric treadmills at the gym, then you might find it a bit too narrow. The length of the belt is also pretty decent for me. As long as you hold onto it, you don't have to worry about falling off.
I did find the decline too steep. The impact is that, since the sliding of the belt is powered by your weight and the angle of the decline, a steeper decline results in faster sliding of the belt for any given weight. At the default angle, the belt slid too fast for me to walk. I put two books under the other end of the treadmill to adjust the decline a bit and it worked perfectly.
Noise - if someone is sleeping in the same room, they will be woken up. If someone is having a video conference in the same room, it's too much noise for that too. But move it into a different room, close the door, and I think it's pretty fine.
Other than these, I haven't found any other issues in particular. Once properly assembled, it holds pretty steadily. I quite like it at the moment - if you have questions feel free to reply below :)"
I brought this treadmill back in October 2019. I have tried to adapt to this treadmill, but I can not. The incline is too high, adjusting the resistance on the belt doesn't seem to help to the mobility of your body. I can't walk on the treadmill without holding on to the bars. When adjusting the belt, the resistants on the treadmill becomes too hard to walk on. It just seems more complicated. It would have been better if the treadmill was able to adjust the incline and a different method of tightening the belt and able to walk without having to hold on to the bars.
"I LOVE this treadmill! I had never liked walking on the treadmill, always an outdoor person. But because the COVID lockdown I was, like everyone else, locked in the house. So I was looking around for a treadmill and this one is perfect for me.
It's a manual treadmill which means you have to work to move he belt. Also the treadmill is set at a 5% incline that cannot be changed. Not sure about running on it but I walked in it with a pace about 15 min/mile for an hour and I am drenched with sweat. And my heart rate also goes up as well.
For the price and the timing, it totally works for me perfectly! Can't be happier."
I'm very pleased with this manual treadmill. It's light, compact, and portable. It took me about 20 mins to put it together, however one of the main bolts didn't have the hexagon Allen wrench hole for me to tighten it so I had to hand tighten it, but it worked. This treadmill is not for a running. You will likely slip and fall if you try to run on this treadmill. It's for someone who only wants to walk or power walk and you must hold on to the handle or you will slip. Also, the walking belt is inclined so it gives you a workout. This treadmill is much quieter than an electronic treadmill. I have gone through 3 good electronic treadmills, however, this manual treadmill works better for me and for much less. Overall, great value and I would definitely recommend it for walkers. I would have given this 5 stars but I took off 1 star for the defective bolt screw I had to work around.
I'm a 73 year old woman and very easily assembled this treadmill in less than an hour. I'm keeping it in my living room rather than hiding it in a bedroom. This is my 3rd Sunny exercise tool! I stick with Sunny because of quality, packing, and all assembly tools are included. The instructions are easy to follow. It recommends 2 people to assemble but easily put it together in less than an hour! Haven't had a chance to use it for a half hour, but gave it a quick walk and it's as smooth as can be. If you're thinking of buying an treadmill, this is your best buy!
This is a very good machine for the price. Assembly was very easy -- it only took about a half hour once everything was unboxed and laid out because there is very little to do -- just a half dozen or so bolts. The instructions were easy to follow, though there was a small error related to which bolts should be used at which assembly step, but it was easy to see how to do it correctly. The only real issue was the belt, which was not centered but drifted off to the left as you used the machine. The instructions explained how to center the belt, but it took several tries before I got it right. Since that initial adjustment, the belt has stayed right down the middle of both the front and back roller bars. Lubricating the underside of the belt was easy (though a little messy). The LCD display was easy to attach, although I have no idea how accurate any of its readouts are. Once assembled, the treadmill worked really well. The belt moves smoothly and quietly and the frame is feels solid and steady -- no vibrations or wobbles or other signs of misalignment or poor fit. I rechecked and tightened all the bolts after a few days of use because any piece of equipment like this will "settle" and loosen a bit on first use. The handlebars are at a fixed height and it is possible you might find them too high or too low. The incline is pronounced but very manageable and adds to the thoroughness of the workout. This treadmill is exactly what we wanted: a machine to get us through the winter without the complexity, weight, size, plug-access hassles or maintenance worries of a motorized unit. I don't see how you can do better for the price. We also have an inexpensive Sunny rowing machine which has been equally reliable. Based on our experiences, the company makes good products.
I gave this 4 stars because I think it's quite effective given its low price. However, you should not expect miracles. It will not replace your fancy motorized treadmill from the fitness center. I find it very good for getting some quick hits of exercise during the day, when otherwise I might be just sitting around at home. I do 100-200 steps on it at a time and find it pretty helpful. However, if the only thing you want to do is run for 30 mins at a certain pace, you're probably going to be disappointed. The pace is not really adjustable and you must hold onto the handlebars. You're basically speedwalking up an incline, holding onto the bars. You can adjust the incline *slightly* by putting a board under the rear end (but if you try to make it flat, it doesn't work). All the same I have found it to be a good value for the money. You just have to adapt to it, and not vice versa.
"Context: I am a mom whose circumstances (closed schools, job I am lucky enough to do remotely, pandemic + wildfires, local gyms all closed) mean I am looking for a practical cardio option in the home.
Pros
- this is easy to assemble (I delegated to my 11-year old).
- very space-friendly. I have this tucked away next to my desk and its small enough that it doesnt require moving or folding each time, I can leave it erected.
- you really can get a good workout out of this. If you stay above 3 - 3.5 miles an hour you can work up a decent heartrate.
Cons:
- the treadmill really is short, and I've gone backwards into the fireplace a couple of times when not concentrating. Treadmill and overall frame size mean this is perfect for me (5'2) but I can imagine not for someone 5'6 upwards and with longer strides.
- lack of versatility. It is only for walking, the incline is fixed, and you do have to hold onto the handles.
- its fairly basic design and I can believe as some reviewers say that it may not survive more than 3 months of daily use.
Conclusion: very good value for money."
Not perfect but definitely worth the price. Belt doesn't line up exactly from front to back no matter how I adjust but it works fine regardless. Also had to clip the plastic guard out of the way to keep it from rubbing the wheel. Been working fine for 3 months.
Great treadmill easy to assemble¸
What I disliked was that it is very steep and once you walk on it, its very slippery and can be dangerous. I did not have a board, table or piece of wood to put under the treadmill like other users suggested but i used equipment pads. I put 3 pieces on each side so far soo good. I did add more lubricant and allowed it to sit for a couple of days before using. After a week of using even my kids use the treadmill the trick is to remain at the front of the treadmill and hold on!!!! Must I say it will definitely give you a workout, even your arms will feel it. So far I have only power walked on the treadmill. I wouldn't recommend this for seniors thoe you really have to hold on.
It was not too difficult to assemble and surprisingly I was able to adjust the belt so it tracks smoothly and centered. I saw some reviews that were critical of the slope and the speed of the belt that resulted from the steep slope. I'm an old guy and the steep slope was hard on my ankles. I put a brick under the two back feet and reduced the slope. Yes, I have to push a bit harder to drive the belt but it's quite acceptable for me. I may try substituting a board instead of the bricks to get a bit more slope and hope my ankles will tolerate the increased slope. The fact that it's not electric keeps it simple and probably more reliable for the long run. The fact I have to work a bit harder doesn't bother me in the least. Be sure to lubricate the belt. I didn't know to lubricate the belt and that is probably why I needed to replaced my previous non electric tread mill.
I am loving my new treadmill! At the moment, like so many of us, I am currently working from home and needed to add some sort of physical activity to my day. I love power walking outdoors in the summer, but the weather hasn't warmed up enough for me yet! This treadmill is exactly what I needed! I was able to assemble it myself, and I was pleased to see that the directions were very clear. Every piece is clearly labeled, and you are provided with all of the tools that you will need. The belt moves smoothly, and I love the fact that since it's manual, I can set my own pace and walk to the beat of the music I'm playing. :) Finally, it's so small and compact that you will have no trouble finding the perfect spot for it in your home. I'm so glad I purchased this and I can't recommend it enough! :)
I had to pay $40 extra to return this item. The item came in a box that was so flimsy and almost ruined. When I tried to put it back in the box, it ripped in several pieces. The item was used and broken in several places. It came with no screws for assembly. I wish I never purchase
"Good quality material. Compact size but more than big enough for average size adult. The incline makes you stand up straight and work your belly muscles. Bought it due to missing my daily 5 mile walks since Covid lockdown started. This is more challenging that my usual stroll but That's good though. Well worth the $156 cost when buying Ships and Sold by Amazon
* it goes in and out of stock at Amazon every few days, sometimes in and out the same day. If it's out, Check back throughout the day or every few days.
It's a good item at a good price. I had a question for the manufacturer and they responded quickly. Please with this purchase."
I figured it was sturdy based on how heavy it was. The instructions are very detailed with easy-to-follow illustrations. There weren't that many pieces to put together. The parts come in a package that are labeled according to which step in the instructions they will be used. They come with the standard cheap tools, like a wrench that makes turning the nuts take forever. I used a ratchet with a ½-inch socket. I lubricated the platform before first use as the instructions ordered. I did three spots (front, middle, and back) under each side of the belt and rubbed it in with a non-absorbent rag. Walking on it was even and smooth, even when I walked slowly. You MUST hold onto the rails, or your speed will get out of control. Your triceps will feel it unless you use an underhand grip. It is all uphill, so you will huff and puff.
Just concerned it was damaged because the box that it's in was way too light to carry such a heavy piece of equipment so it didn't arrive here in very good shape but the treadmill was not damaged at all
So far I really like the treadmill. It's small enough that it fits anywhere in my studio apartment, but large enough that i dont feel like im walking on rope. My only complaint is that it's extremely slippery. I nearly went flying the first time I got on. After a few rounds it started to dry out a little. I strongly suggest holding those bars - I mean they are there for a reason right lol. The product comes with lubricant in case it completely dries out, but so far i haven't needed to.
My wife LOVES this product. My 16 year old daughter put it together and my wife easily puts it away and sets it up twice a day. Only issue I see is that you have to hold onto the rail because once you step on the belt the pressure will make it move and you will fall forward. Step on the sides as indicated, hold onto the rails and begin working. The computer is very simplistic and not really used.
"This is a revised review:
Pros:
-Comes with all of the tools you need to set up and it's fairly easy to set up, however someone might need to help you when you screw it to the base.
-Good instructions, and it comes with belt lube
-Lightweight
Cons:
-Flimsy flywheel covers
-The computer tracker resets too quickly
-The belt moves very fast, at a 5.0 mph running pace if you don't master the walking technique on it. You have to firmly hold on with one hand the front handle, and then with the other hand firmly hold onto the side handle. You also have to brace your abs and look straight ,and deliberately walk slow, and really put your weight into the frame. I had to figure this out on my own and watching a few YT videos of similar manual treadmills.
I emailed customer support for help when the belt went too fast and I didn't get a reply until 5 days later, and they didn't solve my problem at all. I emailed them back, and still waiting for the response. This is lousy customer support. It doesn't take long to respond to an email inquiry to a paid customer, and so this is unexcusable Sunny.
Bottom line:
Overall a solid workout. Perhaps a few phone apps could make the experience even better. I'm being generous with a 4 star rating but overall fair enough."
Its great, a little harder than a regular tread mill because your are using your own foot , leg strength. But I have been using it since I got it. I use it three times a week 45 minutes. I have dropped my weight from 250 to 236. It works, just got to do it. money well spent for your health.
I bought this in January and I'm still using it once or twice a week. It was pretty easy to put together, but getting the tension right so the band doesn't skew off to the side took some trial and error. Many people would buy a mat to protect the floor, but I used a panel of the cardboard box it came in. I like that it's really easy to fold up and move out of the way, and that I don't have to plug it in. The slope is a bit of a killer, so I've propped up the back of it with a board to decrease it and make it easier. In time, as it becomes less of a challenge, I can remove the board to increase the slope.
I should've read the reviews more thoroughly. I have broke this back down and packaged this back up to send it back after having it a little over a month. This machine could potentially be dangerous. The belt slides and moves out of place and if you're not holding on to the rails at all times you can really easily slip off and get hurt. The small digital part also never worked or stayed on correctly. You can not adjust the include and it's not electric so you have to walk or run uphill during the whole workout without being able to use your arms. Not productive or efficient. As soon as I am refunded I am buying a different electric treadmill.
"I bought a treadmill and an elliptical from Sunny since I'm not planning to go back to the gym during the pandemic, and wanted variety for my 60-minute daily workouts.
This treadmill came with assembly instructions that featured an exploded diagram of many, many parts, which I found overwhelming although I'm fairly handy and can usually follow instructions.
I managed to assemble it, but the belt started migrating immediately, and made a nasty rubbing noise.
I followed the instructions and used the lubricant provided, but it was still noisy, always sounding like something was rubbing against something it wasn't supposed to be rubbing against, annoying and worrisome.
I called Sunny and the tech told me to use the entire bottle of lubricant. Fine, but why wasn't that in the detailed instructions?
It was still noisy, so I called the Sunny tech again and had her listen to it, she said that noise was normal.
I used it for 2 weeks, then the belt started to migrate. I had to use the special tool provided to try to center it, which didn't really work.
Also, the speed isn't adjustable”there's only one speed”and, as other reviewers have mentioned, the incline isn't adjustable either.
I'd recommend the elliptical over the treadmill. I wanted to have both, but at the moment I'm too frustrated with the treadmill to spend more time trying to get it to work properly."
"A few points. It compact - so it's small. The belt is only about a little more than shoulder width apart. I'm 5'6"" so it fits my stride but probably not someone much taller. Perfect behind my couch.
It's manual - it will make you do all the work. Keep it oiled once a month. It stops as soon as you stop. With the fixed incline you will get a good workout.
I walk about 30 min every other day. I'm 3 months postpartum with my 3rd child - under 6 years old. It does what I need. If I was in the shape I was pre baby it would be a light workout.
It was easy to assemble and delivered timely and in great condition."
I went back and fourth on this purchase because of the bad reviews. Glad I didn't listen and ordered it. So far I'm liking it. I see how the track moves to the left a little but it re adjusts itself or its easy to guide it back. There's also metal at the bottom that keeps it in place. Its a good workout because it's manuel and at a inclined I read its like 13.5%(moderate) incline. I will update my review in a few weeks but so far week one I'm loving it!!
"I like the size. Fits in my small room and isn't obtrusive. It already comes mostly assembled so there are only 4 steps to connect each section together. The assembly manual makes it look complicated but it's not.
My only gripe is the incline on it. I wanted a treadmill just to walk because I got some leg issues but with the incline not only do I feel like I'm going to slide off but I also can't walk as long as I'd like to because I tire so easily. Wanted to do a simple 20min walk but could only do 5 minutes before I became too tired to continue. Also the grip isn't very good when taking the incline in account. The handlebar grips are kind of smooth styrofoam so I can easily see myself losing grip one day and falling on my face.
I pretty much have to hold on for my dear life on this thing. I guess it will take some time getting used to but it's definitely not a cake walk compared to other new treadmills I've tried. It's good but I don't find this one very accommodating, but I guess that's expected for the price."
At first it seemed okay but after a couple of uses the sheet keeps moving to one side iam trying to return it but I don't even see the option for returning so disappointed ðŸ˜ž I was getting so excited about using it.
I workout everyday and bought this to add to my home gym so I have variety at home during quarantine. It was easy to assemble and it is definitely easy to maneuver but there is still one reason I don't use it often like all of my other home equipment.... it is super hard to walk on it without holding on to it! I am an athlete, I also run all the time, and I love challenging myself, which is the reason I wanted a manual treadmill (to do the work myself) but I can barely walk on this. It is just not as smooth as I would hope and I literally last 5 min walking on it before feeling uncomfortable and annoyed. Just my personal experience.
"The product itself is high quality but the running belt with the permanent elevated position that it comes in makes it very slippery and dangerous, to help it I keep a carpet under neath the back portion of this treadmill to give it a slightly better grip but all in all ? Save your money / look else where I wanted to return it but didn't keep the box it came in and didn't have a big humongous enough to return it and didn't want the hassle so I kept it for a partial refund
The function = 1 star and over all quality 3 stars"
"Compact, super easy to fold and move. Stands sturdy. Incline is difficult, so I took the legs off of an Ikea table and put it under the back end of the treadmill (another reviewer recommended putting a piece of wood, and I had the table handy. It is sturdy on the wood and requires you to hold the handles, but much easier to walk and doesn't put as much strain on my wrists (hurt wrists alot prior to putting wood). I tie my Fitbit to my shoe laces so steps are calculated and I'm good to go!
I love this little treadmill."
"I love this treadmill! I live in a condo so space is limited. I really like how compact this treadmill folds and how little space it takes up in my living room. So far I've only powerwalked on it but I just ordered running shoes specifically for use on this machine so I will try running on it soon. I probably won't be able to run without hanging onto the handlebars but I don't mind. I'm used to running in that position after pushing my kids in a running stroller for nearly 5 years now.
It was very easy to put together, however the belt is a little tricky to adjust. But I got the hang of it (the instructions tell you how to adjust) and I was able to center the belt and keep it centered.
I found it to be pretty quiet compared to motorized treadmills; my husband and I watched a movie while I walked on it. If it was too loud, he definitely wouldn't have been able to sit through the noise through a whole movie."
I really like the fact that it is small and it folds easily to put away. I have a big one on my back garage that I never use. I assembled it and oiled it before I started walking on it makes the band rolled down easier while walking you must hold on the entire time so you won't fall since you are using your own strength, the treadmill is elevated on the front area. I'm 5'4 and weigh 165 Lb and holds me no problem. My daughter likes walking on it too, especially when the weather is bad out. I would not recommend this for running.
This product can't be used. I am beyond disappointed. The built-in incline is too high. You have to hold on for dear life in order to use the machine. You cannot enter a natural stride and you have to stay near the very front of the belt in order to be able to hold on. I wanted something I could mimic taking a walk with. You can't use it without holding on to the bars which are also too short. I am trying to find how to return this if possible. It can't be used. Also it's 200 down the drain and now I'll have to purchase one that I can actually use. I raised the back by lifting it on books and that helped just a little. This is frustrating.
Is very easy to use, we bought it for my mother in law, so she can do some exercise during this quarantine. Since is so easy to use my 9 year old niece had been very enthusiastic about it. I am very please.
I love this machine. Got it yesterday, assembled it by myself, and was up and using it in no time. I'm 5'8 and the belt length and width were just fine for me. I will agree with other reviews that the incline is too steep for a manual treadmill, but we fixed it by placing a board at the end. It's a really simple machine, no bells and whistles or anything, but it's perfect if you just need to space out and walk, especially if you're on lockdown for a pandemic. ðŸ¤˜
I love this, I use it every day I don't have to go out in the 105 temp. to take a walk. I have it on the tightest setting so I can just walk normal. I find walking toward the front works best for me, walking back goes a little too fast for me. Use the side places to put your feet on before and after walking for balance. I am 74 works great for me.
As a 78 year old whose lab equipment days are long behind her, dI appreciated the simple assembly and the way the parts were organized. It is a much heavier and sturdier item than I expected for the price. It works well for me, but I am short and about 120lbs so I dont know how well it will do for larger people. As I am staying mostly in my apartment and weather has been wet here, the manual treadmill set up in front of my TV is perfect for my coronavirus stay at home times. I like the slope because it is easier on my arthritic knees and hips. I was also surprised at how quickly it arrived. All in all, one of my best purchases from amazon.
It's not worth more than 50dollars. I bought it because it was less than 200dollars. I need something to walk in the morning before work but this is not good at all. I can't walk on it because it kept on rolling faster than i need. I i am returning it
Received my treadmill yesterday. Did the Prime Trial, saved 34 bucks on shipping, which took only 4 days. Driver could not come into my building because of the virus to help me, so I had to take this up three flights of stairs by myself. I am a weak 52 year old chick so hauling 60 pounds took about 25 minutes, had to open the box downstairs and take it up piece by piece. NOT FUN. Next, the assembly. VERY DIFFICULT. It took about 90 minutes. Again, very heavy base and it almost smashed down on my ankle given the way you have to hold the base to connect it to the rails. Take my advice, have a second person help you, preferably a strong dude! After assembly, this machine is HUGE for a manual. It takes up about a third of my living room, where I gave it its own designated space. I plan to leave it open. I suppose you could fold it but you'd be hauling 60 pounds every time. I have only used it for a few minutes after assembly to make sure the belt worked and it seems to work well. Overall, I am impressed with the price ($170 inc. tax), the size and the belt and computer. Just keep in mind that it is heavy and requires two people to assemble. Other than that, great machine from Sunny Health.
I purchased this manual treadmill because of Covid19 SIP. I'm very pleased with it so far. It's small and compact. Assembly was easy It took me about 30 mins to put it together. Easy to use you do have to hold on to the handle bars or you will fall back I easily can reach 3.9 with ease. It is a workout so get ready to burn calories!
"It looks like it will suit my needs. Small and compact. Good for people of smaller stature (I am 5'1""). Waiting for a response to replace broken plastic pieces found upon opening box--disappointed. Hoping for a quick response from the vendor. Will update further.
Update:
After reaching out to Sunny's customer service about the broken parts I received a relatively quick response (considering delays because of Covid). The replacement parts were quickly shipped. Not a treadmill that some people may expect from larger models. The incline is steep enough for a decent workout. Very happy."
"It took my boyfriend and I about 1.5 hours to assemble.
Before reading please know I never owned a Manuel treadmill and didn't know what to expect. I have only used automatic ones in the gym.
I have never owned a Manuel treadmill before and thought I give it a try. Total fail. I could not control the speed of the treadmill at all. We tighten it until we could not tighten it anymore. I'm on the heavier side so I think the gravity of my weight just keep increasing the speed. Each time I started walking I instantly went to a speed of at least 2.
My goal was to get something I could use to walk very slow ( speed of 1 or lower) while I'm on work meetings.
I returned the product which was very easy. UPS came to pick it up for me at my front door. It could have been user error but I now have an automatic one I really like."
I like the compact size. Doesn't take up alot of room. That being said, its really disappointing that after trying to tighten the belt so it didn't move so fast that it still moved pretty fast. My doctor wants me to walk more for my bones but at the rate the belt moves ill probably end up breaking one. Most of the reviews I read was good but I wish I would have done more research on this product. I wanted a compact treadmill that was easy to use and didn't take up alot of space but this is ridiculous on how it works.
This is exactly what I wanted! It is compact, easy to maneuver and convenient. It arrived in less than a week and I am completely satisfied.
I bought this for my father in law who is 89 years old. He is afraid he will fall off of is electronic treadmill, so this was the perfect solution. Now he can walk at his own speed and stop without fear of tripping or falling. I have used other brands before and was not too impressed. But, this one is adjustable and it really works good at a slight incline. I think you could use it everyday and get plenty of your money's worth out of it.
So far I really like this treadmill. It has a good height incline which you can't adjust but it's not so high that it's a problem. I use it 4-5 times a week and no problems so far. I had to go through the company to get a new sensor wire because it is exposed and breaks off easily, with a lot of old glue around it. They weren't very helpful and they finally sent the wire after a lot of email but the directions to put it in are super confusing. Now I keep ducktape around that area so it won't break off again.
I was very worried upon ordering this treadmill. I feared it would be hard to put together, that the belt wouldn't move or it would be damaged upon arrival. None of those happened. It took me maybe 30-40 minutes to assemble with easy to follow instructions. The belt is actually super slippery. A little too much. I stepped on and almost fell off because the belt slipped out from under my feet but thank god for the railing. You definitely have to hold on the whole time you walk/jog. Jogging is possible but be careful. You will need to step farther up on the belt to make it move. Stepping in the middle causes it to slip a lot. It's not unusable tho. The only major problem I had was that the delivery driver dropped it in the leasing office and not my front door. I had to lug the huge, heavy box all the way back to my apartment building 2 blocks away on the 2nd floor. Definitely not easy to move. It's super convenient for small apartments. I walked a mile with not many problems. I am 5'2 and weigh 160lbs and it's perfect for me. I wouldn't suggest you buy it if you're taller than 5'4. My legs reach the end of it while walking. It's worth the price and assembly!
This treadmill is perfect for a small room. My father needs to walk more after a bypass surgery but this treadmill was more of a hill walk and it was dangerous for him. So I decided instead of returning it I'll just make it lower. I could've made this lower but it looks a lot safer when he uses it now. It was 8 and I brought it down to 6. One side already had a hole which is used to put the screw when you fold it. In this case he's not planning on folding it so it worked perfect.
I usually walk in my neighborhood for exercise but I needed an indoor option. This treadmill is perfect. I needed something compact & movable. Not having the floor space to commit to an electric treadmill and on a budget this is a great solution. The track runs smoothly. It's quiet. And it folds up and sits against the wall. The stand extends about a foot from the wall so it can't be stored behind a door but it's out of the way in my bedroom. Great for walking & getting in those extra steps.
"The flywheel covers cracked. I had to glue them back together but did not try to reattach.
The treadmill monitor does not keep track like it should of time, etc. I had my handyman look at it and he had no explanation for that. Installation was correct.
Otherwise, I like the workout I get. I only use it for a few minutes at a time until I can get stronger.
I got no reply to my complaints. I would not return the machine, but feel I should get some money back for the defective parts like the flywheel cover and monitor.
I can use it without those problems I see, but just feel I shouldn't have to pay the full price, especially since I got no support. from the company"
Worst product ever!!! Was thrilled to receive this and when i opened the box multiply broken pieces. Had to wait 2 weeks. Now i cant even get a hold of anyone because they are closed. Dont bother wasting your time buying a broken equipment you cant use. Waste waste waste of money. And then as a prime member amazon tells me i have to wait 2 weeks to get my refund. Worthless
At first use, this was a great buy. Feel good about the price for what I got. The belt is a little choppy sometimes”has a little trouble keeping smooth as you walk/run. That being said it's still a good product at this price point. I wish I knew how to fold it because that'd be a big help but it's a great size for an apartment even when fully out.
The treadmill has absolutely no braking system. If you put one foot on it to get started, it will throw you off, or worse, crash your head into the bar or down on the floor. If you can get on it without hurting yourself, to get off it you must put both feet on the side boards at the same exact time----no kidding!!~!
Takes 2 to put together easily. Doesn't fold easily. It takes minimal space and is a bare bones treadmill. It has a set grade, upward slant, so combined with the manual aspect, seems to provide a good workout. I keeps in my office and use throughout the day. I am very happy with the unit. A few comments: you have to hold on to the handle bars, doesn't have any connectivity to any fitness apps, tracks the usual tome,mph,speed,etc.
I never write reviews, but I must this time. I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews! I was a little worried, but I'm so happy I bought it. It arrived in just 4 days! I was NOT looking for something to jog/run on. All I wanted was something I could walk on to get some extra steps/keep moving without leaving my apartment and maybe work up a little sweat. This was perfect for my needs. It was easy to assemble. It's not very easy for me to move around the carpet in my apartment, but it's lightweight and not a huge deal. I lubricated the belt as others recommended. I find that this will cause the belt to slide faster (obviously) which causes your speed to pick up, and which ultimately forces you to grab onto the handrail out of fear of possibly sliding off. None of this bothers me. It doesn't bother me that there is a fixed incline either. If anything, I like that it pushes me to work just a bit harder. I'm hoping that with time, I find my footing and the belt runs a bit more smoothly. If not, I'm happy either way. It does have a sound when you walk on it, but it's not SUPER loud imo. I weigh 125 pounds for reference. All in all, it does what I want it to and I have no regrets about my decision to buy it. If it is going to irritate you to have to maybe hold on to the hand rails, if you can't handle the fixed incline (only 9 inches), and if you are not looking for something that might end up being a little more fast paced (my normal speed while walking on it is about 2.7/2.8), then this might not be the product for you. If you are looking for something just to get moving/get some steps in and maybe work up a little sweat, this is perfect.
Not for everyone but for folks who aren't too big (6'+) or too small (5.5'-)and just want something simple/lo-tech to jump on and break a sweat it's pretty good...and for not a lot of money. As other reviews will tell you, it either works for you or it doesn't, and the only way to know for sure is to try...so keep the packaging in case you need to send back. For me, its for walking not running and it took a little while to find the right body placement along the track to manage a comfortable pace, but I'm getting the hang of it just in time for winter. Also, keep extra track lubrication on hand. In our dry household it seems we'll need to touch up more often.
"It's a great little machine. Well built and gives you an awesome workout. You WILL sweat! I've had it a year and no issues with the machine itself.
I unfortunately can't be on it for more then 10 minutes. I have bursitis in the thighs and I have to give mine up. Anyone without joint issues will have no problem using it. I have to sell mine due to the fact my body is falling apart and I'm bummed because I love it."
Very happy with this unit for the money. We bought it as a cost-effective & portable back-up exercise option on those inclement days when we can't get outside to run or walk. It gives a wonderful power-walking cardio workout with it's preset incline. Admittedly, it's a much different (and safer) experience than a motorized treadmill because YOU are the power source. You stop, it stops. It's very light & portable and folds up nicely to carry in/out of the garage.
We got this during the pandemic because we weren't walking outside very much anymore. It's perfect and cheap for this purpose. It's easy to put together and I usually walk at a 3.5 mile pace and do 1-2 miles a day on it to replace the walking I did to my office. My husband is a little too tall for it - he's 6'4 - but we added some poles to the sides so he can use it more comfortably.
This treadmill came with no directions with it.We had to look on the box and pray that we assembled it the correct way.The treadmill works great and it's perfect for a small space.
"So this product is a great solution while we're all still avoiding gyms. I live in an area where it gets extremely hot and extremely cold so I'm excited to have this option when walking outside isn't feasible. It's a great investment for the price, takes up almost no room, is decently quiet (you could use it while other family members are sleeping if across the house with the door shut), and folds to sit in a closet.
My only complaints:
The belt shouldn't have the logo on it. When that part of the belt goes through the top part of the cycle, it's not smooth and you have to walk a bit faster for a couple of seconds. Very hard to explain but essentially it's not consistent. If you are in any way not 100% confident in your ability to walk on an incline and to not have complete control, this is not for you.
A question- is there a way to remove the incline?"
So I just got this, and I paid a little extra to have it shipped a bit earlier. I was supposed to have gotten a different treadmill from another company, but they kind of fell through and I bought this one instead. It arrived well in the time frame. It says to have two people work on it, but you can build it on your own as long as you use common sense and are in reasonable physical shape. It took me about a half hour to maybe an hour, but that was from my own little mistakes. So far it seems nice. They did a wonderful job of packaging and even the supplies were packaged with step indicators. Very nice presentation. I am sad that it only will hold up to 220lbs. because I wanted my husband to be able to use it too, but he said he'll just work on his own so he can get low enough to enjoy it with me. One of the only real issues I have at this moment from just setting it up and walking on it a few seconds was that it seemed to stick a bit, and that I didn't feel strong enough to tighten the side bars to the base. The bars ARE secure, but will shift forward when I apply pull pressure. And that was after taking pliers and the wrench to them. I will probably need to ask my dad or husband for help when they get home. they have tighter grips and stronger arms than myself. Overall, for being the first day this product seems fine.
"PROS
Compact & lightweight
Easy to assemble
No operational hiccups
CONS
No adjustment to height, gradient at either front or back end. It is fixed at an uphill angle.
No resistance adjustment. You must hold on to the handles at all times to remain on the belt or you slide out from the back. There is no workaround by raising the backend to create a level belt walking surface to be able to multi-task with a tablet. The unit stops running. However, if you are just watching something while you are walking on the belt, having hands tied up might not matter."
This treadmill works for small spaces and small people. The only person in our family of 5 who could use it effectively was my 9 year old daughter. My 13 year old son could only full sprint in it. My 15 year old son and husband were to big for it. I, as a 5'4 woman, could not maintain a steady speed. I thought a manual treadmill would require force to make it work. I liked the idea of working harder to push the belt. But for me the first step or two were the pushing I was looking for, then the belt started moving on it's own and I had to sprint to keep up.
Better than what I expected. You can actually get a legit workout on this. The speed goes according to the speed of your walk. You can jog on this machine. I don't recommend running because you can fall off. I personally use this machine to walk really fast & definitely gets my heart rate up. Hope this machine last me atleast a year. It is a bit flimsy, not super sturdy so ever so often you may have to tighten everything up.
"I really wanted to like this manual, folding treadmill, you guys. I was so excited about it after having read some of the more positive reviews, and asking my coworkers about it. But this thing is terrifying/nearly impossible to use!
The incline combined with the weird fast/slow resistance of the actual belt made it impossible for me to stay on this thing for longer than 2 minutes.
The sad thing is, I have no idea how I'm going to return this thing, so I'll likely just list it on Craigslist, or donate it to whoever wants it in my apartment building's basement.
Though, I'll have to leave a warning note on it. The size is as advertised, and it was simple enough to put together, but this thing is going to injure someone for sure one day."
"Hated it. Returned it.
I knew what I was getting into - it's a manual treadmill that needed me to get the belt moving. Fine. I'm 130 lbs., so not a big deal. Also, I'm fairly fit and used to walking 5 - 6 miles a day, no problem. This treadmill was ridiculous. The belt wouldn't move smoothly enough. I oiled it, loosened it, reoiled it, tightened it. I messed with it for 3 days before giving up and returning it.
Absolute rip off for close to $200."
There is a huge difference between a manual and electric treadmill. You burn more calories with a manual. This treadmill is very quiet. Its a must I hang onto the handle bars while in use but worth every dollar. Easy to assemble and move around. I would buy again!
This treadmill is absolutely perfect! Easy to assemble, Easy to fold, Perfect for small spaces, Affordable and does its job. It arrived super fast!
Very content with this treadmill. It doesn't take up a lot of space and gets the job done. It takes a little getting used to, and you do need to hold onto the rail with at least one hand. It is not easy to truly run on it, so I would not recommend it for that, but you can jog comfortably at a an 8 mph pace or walk a lowly or at a fast pace. It was easy to set up and I can move it around with easy. Even if this only lasts a few month, to me it will have been worth the price. I've had it for a few days and have used it daily with no issues. I highly recommend this treadmill, just manage your expectations and know that it is not your typical treadmill.
"Muy buena inversiÃ³n, al ser manual no esta el problema de la manutenciÃ³n del motor y etc. A parte que tu puedes definir el ritmo que quieres y cuando empezar o parar de caminar. Hay que tomar en cuenta que la cinta esta elevada por adelante y eso para permitir que la cinta gira al caminar, eso dificulta un poco el empezar, pues parece que estas siempre subiendo una cuesta... Pero al seguir el ejercicio te acostumbras. A parte hay que estar caminando siempre con las manos en el los mangos para master equilibrio.
La calidad es muy buena, muy bien explicado para el montaje (aÃºn sin saber ingles). Por ahora estoy muy contenta!!! Fue una buena compra!!"
"I was looking for a small manual treadmill and Sunny Health & Fitness turned out to be a great purchase. Here the reasons why I am giving 5 stars:
1) affordable price
2) fast delivery
3) easy to assemble (I am not good at assembling things but I was able to assemble the treadmill in 1 hour!)
4) foldable (I live in a very small studio, the treadmill is light, easy to move around, after working out I fold it and store in a corner, so convenient!)
5) so far I am happy with the quality: I use it every morning for 45 min and I have no complaints about the treadmill.
6) it is manual so you save on electricity!
Keep in mind that this is a walking treadmill, so if you want to run this might not be the best fit for you."
Works great for getting those steps in in the winter or when you just need a quick 15 min walk. I use a 2X4 under the back so the incline isn't as steep. I am 205lbs and the treadmill moves fast 3.5mph and higher when I don't have the board under and/or am not holding on with one hand. I would not feel safe or physically fit enough to run on it. The incline is steeper then you think and it feel fragile for my weight if I were to run. As you can see I have a NordicTrack bike for regular workouts. The incline will get your heart rate bumping just like my bike does. I use the treadmill to get steps in since the bike workout doesn't always count towards steps on my Fitbit. I have had it for 2 weeks no problems so far. Assembly was quick. Will be buying more oil for the tread it does tend to dry up. If you have the ability to buy something nicer I would; but this works for walking. I like how small it is folded up and works as a good supplement for walks outside; as well as a good 15min break when you need to move from your at home desk.
Today, was my first time using my treadmill. I really like it! It does the work. I have used a manual treadmill a long time ago and I did not like, I was hesitating to make this purchase, but now I am glad I gave it the shot!! - You have to really work out on this one, it ain't that easy as is the electric is. Also, you have to be with your hands all the time holding the holders, if not you will fall. I sweat a lot today, and that says something to me because I rarely sweat. My heartbeat was good too. I mean, so far so good. I am happy with it.
This is an excellent treadmill. If you want to walk on it you just need to be closer to the top. If you prefer to run just step back half way down to the belt. You must hold on but that is the same for any manual treadmill. This is on an incline and you definitely get a better workout than an electric treadmill.
Received the product in a timely manner. The problem was that the plug -in part that connects to frame was broken off its "spot". No answer by phone. Then sent email as advised. Never did I receive any info to solve the problem. I sent picture & all pertinent info requested. I asked for a replacement part only. All one had to do was take out screw & replace small part with another. Since no reply decided to try self fix.(tape) Exercise computer does not work. Treadmill works well if you don't care to know time, speed, distance & calories burned. Oh, it might work, if I had someone to guide me through!
the incline makes it hard to walk on, I was so excited when I received it but had to return because I couldn't walk on it.
Pretty terrible if you use as intended. The incline is way to steep to keep a slow walking pace. I disregarded the instructions and propped up the back, and now it works fine for me, hence the two stars instead of 1. You definitely get what you pay for with this one, it's nothing fancy.
"Let me tell you how much I love this treadmill ! I was skeptical to buy it. I searched it on YouTube and it didn't look that bad. I live in a small apartment and was desperate for something to keep me in shape.
It took my fiancÃ© and I maybe 20 minutes to put it together. I've been going on it for 30 minutes everyday and I work up such a sweat.
I'm 5'7 150lbs and my fiancÃ© is 6'3 225 lbs and it works great for us.
I 100% recommend."
I bought this when the gyms closed due to COVID 19. It was a lifesaver. It took several 30 min sessions to get accustomed to the angle and adjust my pace, but for the money it works just fine. I set it where I can watch TV and the time passes quickly. I am 5'3" and it is a good size for me. I consider it money well spent.
This is a great treadmill. I think it is over priced. It fits well in my small apartment and folds up out of the way. I would recommend.
After two months so far I'm pleased. Makes me wonder why years ago I paid a grand for a fancy motorized one. Same sweat, lots cheaper! If this lasts another 20 pounds..I would buy again.
Perfectly fits my needs. Great value and kick butt workout! Highly recommend!
We place it and every time we go by we briefly use it. It is great. the climbing angle is a hair to high,but lifting the back does it.I won't take a star from it since this is matter of personal preferences.I had some initial computer issues,but the manufacturer stand by it and replace the culprit in no time.Thank you
I purchased this as I didn't want to spend alot of money on a treadmill bc I bought other excerxise equipment too. And I have heard of alot of bad experiences with manual treadmills but not this one. It's easy to assemble, came with all the parts, fits into small spaces and folds up nicely. Most of all it works great. No issues.
I did not realize I would have to assemble this product but at least it was not too difficult. I also did not realize this product is at a permanent incline; it is not level. I bought it because I was having surgery and needed something to help me after surgery. Unfortunately for me, I could not use this product due to the permanent incline the incline makes it necessary to hold onto the handles. Following surgery I was unable to hold the handles. Do not recommend unless you want the incline.
I was really hoping to like this. A manual treadmill seems like a great idea. But the belt just would not stay centered. The manual shows how to center the belt by turning two screws, but repeated adjustments simply didn't have any effect. I had to return it.
I like the weight and width. The device works nicely with my weight. I do not like the length or position of the handle bars. The belt moves quick and requires me to walk on the upper area where the bolts hold the device together, causing creaking sounds. I have to stretch my arms to hold on to the treadmill if I'm maintaining the proper distance on the belt (farther from the bolts).
"This puppy is at an ANGLE. I underestimated how steep it would feel. Definitely have to hold onto bar or else you'll shoot off the back.
After originally putting it together, the belt kept slipping to one side. Took several days to get it tweaked just right. Instructions were backwards in manual regarding which direction to turn screws in the adjust tension."
Just got this in today. Easy to assemble but one screw holding the railing on doesn't go in well so it's wobbly. You need to hold on for this treadmill to be safe and the wobble makes it less comfortable to walk on.
It's small enough to keep in the corner of my bedroom so now there are fewer excuses and more incentive to walk at my own pace.
I'm a 63 year old female who put this together in less than an hour by myself. This is much needed now that gyms are closed as I have COPD and need to walk to strengthen my lungs & body. Very easy to fold up and much bigger than I thought. It makes some noise and takes some getting used to as its manual but its works for what I need. Can feel the muscles working with the incline. Only con, incline doesn't seem to be adjustable.
"Just assembled Step 1 when I noticed an imperfection in the running belt. (See photo)
I paid seller (BC) $239, which I should be refunded a decent discount. I'd be willing to keep it bc I don't feel like disassembling Step 1 & struggling to put it all back in the box.
If I can't be issued a discount, of course I will get it in the box.
Looks like a diagonal piece-mill repair. Please advise."
As an alternative to attending my outdoor boot camp workout, I use this manual treadmill. The permanent elevation and manual function (not motorized) gives me a good workout while watching my shows on TV. I think this treadmill was a great purchase. Easy for one person to assemble. I haven't folded it up yet since I use it often. If you are looking for a low priced piece of indoor equipment this is it.
I really like the treadmill I just wish the handrails were larger because its difficult to keep your grip and balance at the same time. The treadmill was easy to assembly and doesn't take up a lot of space and is functional. My heart rate was up to 178 and I was sweating profusely on the first try. You cannot let go or you will learn to fly! Overall I like it, just want bigger/longer handrails.
I can only walk very little before my legs give out. So no outside. So I got this treadmill. It actually is comfortable for my problem. You do have to watch out or you'll fall off. Lol. Hold on tight till you learn how to control it instead of it controlling you. A tad noisey but durable comfy. Takes up a little space. Cool product. Glad I got it!
"Built it the night it came. Used it. Maybe put 5 miles on it. Broke the next day. A metal clanking sound started coming from the top left barring. We couldn't tell what it was with out taking it apart. We didn't do this.
Waited a week for an email from Sunny Co. that wasn't an automated response.
Ended up returning it.
It's a shame...I was happy with it...."
I'm about an hour into using this treadmill, it's great. It's in my livingroom for now but it's easy to wheel to other spaces. I took a pic next to the lamp and trash can to give you a sense of the space it takes up. It's not as nice as a fancy gym treadmill but it's great for a small budget. The incline is a lot but it meant I raised my heart rate without much effort. A win in my book.
This item is amazing. It is very easy to assemble and set up. It fits in small areas which is great and it does not take a lot of space. The incline is perfect and it is easy to use. I recommend this item for sure. Very nice.
This treadmill is great for the price. You do need to hold on with at least one hand, although you could probably adjust the slope by putting something under the back to lessen the incline. I'm 5'9 and was worried it would be too short for me but I can use it comfortably. Definitely recommend.
I really like this manual small treadmill, The instructions were not too hard to follow at all. Not a lot of assembly. I did add the oil underneath the belt which does ease up on the traction. I have to say, just walking gives you quite a cardio workout! I really wanted a treadmill while I watch shows instead of just sitting. This is so perfect for that!
This item felt highly unstable and adjusting the belt tension was trickier than I would have liked. It may be a perfectly suitable treadmill for a lighter individual who doesn't mind adjusting and re-adjusting. For someone approaching the weight limit, gravity worked a little too well and this machine felt like an accident waiting to happen.
Wouldn't listen to the bad reviews. Nice compact treadmill. Even in a small bedroom it has fit perfectly with plenty of space still around it. Folds up easily as well. Have had no problems with walking on it and so on. It's a good product for the price.
Excellent price point. Also well built for the money spent.
Very easy to use and put together. I will suggest to really lubricate every part before using it. It is really a good purchase. I have other gym's machines and this one is right there.
"This treadmill does and is, exactly what it's seller claims. It's well made, easy to assemble and it looks good. And because it needs no electrical power, it can be used anytime...anywhere!
Great price, great product!"
The manual treadmill is a good option for older people or those with bad knees as you can go at your own pace. It was not hard to assemble, and is a bit longer than a large living room chair and not quite as wide. As we put it together, the handlebar section shakes a bit when someone runs hard on it, but it has held up OK against my active randsons.
This treadmill is not an easy treadmill. Expect there to be a learning curve when you get it. It takes a bit of playing around to find your stride with this since it's manual. Be careful because your feet might fly out from under you!! I put a stepper under the back to reduce the incline and it made it to wear it didn't feel like your feet were running away from you. Oh and you have to unscrew a bolt to fold it up. It isn't just a push and release foldable. Good little find just remember it will take some practice to get smooth with it

Requires to hold to be used, not worth it for me as I have difficulty using it, if I have a chance I will buy automatic more features and easy to use not the manual like this. The same brand like "Sunny Health & Fitness SF-T7515 Smart Treadmill with Auto Incline, Sound System, Bluetooth and Phone Function".
"l don't normally write reviews and it is just the first day, but the tread mill went together just fine and for the short time I used l
have no complaints. It is different than a power tread mill, but with a little practice I think I've gotten the hang of of keeping
The tempo even.
A Dimasi"
"Easy to set up. Only issue is the angle is steep for a beginner. I've propped up the back on books for a more level surface. Also - even with lubricating the belt, it doesn't run smoothly and will jolt to a stop at times.
Have had second thoughts about the purchase but will continue to use. For now."
"Has a very small foot print when folded, assembly was relatively easy, took about 25 minutes.
Works great and costs half the price of most other units. Yes its manual but is that not the
point of working out. You walk, jog, or run at your own pace. I am very pleased with
the quality and price of this unit."
I knew it would be harder to operate but on the plus side one can use it for shorter time as it requires more energy than the electric. Small enough not to take over a room. I got Amazon technician to set up so don't know how hard it would be for the average person to set up. Overall happy with purchase
"It was a little awkward getting it up to my 2nd floor apartment, but other than that, this was a breeze to assemble, even by myself (with an assist by my yoga bricks). I'm able to store and use it in a corner of my apartment where it's completely out of the way, and doesn't disrupt the flow of the space.
The fixed incline is a little steep for me, so I can't walk on it without holding the bar, or else I'll slide right off. However, holding on with one hand works, so my Fitbit hand can still swing free and pick up my steps & heart rate.
If I could give this a 4.5 star rating instead of just 4 stars, I would. I'm very pleased with this purchase, and look forward to using this treadmill for years to come!"
I think this treadmill will work for me but a part was cracked when we received the package. The package was fine on the outside but a plastic fender part was damaged. see photo. It is still usable but I could have been happier.
I am so happy with this manual treadmill! Easy to start and stop, no problems. Relatively quiet and gives me quite a workout! Steady, smooth walking surface, I had read that manual treadmills might be harder on your knees but not this one. So happy with this purchase and highly recommend this.
Sure, this treadmill is very inexpensive, but honestly it's not even worth it. It's very cheaply made, and the incline makes for a very awkward walking position. I did not feel stable or secure, and the the belt tension was way too loose even when adjusting almost all the way to add more tension. Frame is wobbly even with bolts tightened to the point of stripping the nuts. Cheap, poorly constructed junk. If you're on a really tight budget go for it, but keep your expectations low. Otherwise, spend a little more and get something better quality. I was not satisfied--even for the price-- and sent mine back.
I would recommend this treadmill. It took us about 30 minutes to assemble it and everything you need to assemble it came with it. Great product for an affordable price.
Not what I expected at all. You have to hold the bars the entire time while walking, or you'll fly backwards. For some, that may be ok but for me I found it extremely difficult. The set up was easy but sadly I had to return it. The treadmill just wasn't for me. Hoping the return process goes smoothly.
This product has its pros and cons. For the pros, it is small for small spaces and not hard to assemble, however, for the cons, it is hard to fold and unfold and as the price suggests it is cheaply made and very flimsy, I think I'm going to fall every time I get on it. I should have pay more for a more sturdy machine.
This little manual treadmill is fantastic for a quick workout! It has me sweating after just one song on my playlist. Since it's manual, you personally are in control of your speed so it really makes you work your legs and abs harder. The speed is inconsistent because of this, but I think over time once you get used to it, it will run much smoother for you. Easy to assemble! Done in about 20 min. I love that it folds up too to save space. Perfect cheap exercise equipment to have while the gyms are closed
This is perfect for small spaces. It's easy to use, light enough to move, perfect for an apartment or just for anyone. I'm 5'6 and it's perfect height. The incline gives a tough enough workout in 10 minutes for those of us just used to walking so I do 10 min a few times a day. It's a great product and I've recommended it to several friends.
It's great! Very easy to assemble, quiet, and sturdy. Perfect for someone who lives in an apartment on the 2nd floor or higher who enjoys working out.
"First when I received it, it was already assembled how with no instructions I had to figure out how to unfold.
Second because of the incline it helps start off your workout but be prepared to hold on to the bars. Unless you are a really fast runner, you can let go.
Third the track for mine is way to the left so it runs on the side making the treadmill slow down every so often."
This is perfect! My dad put it together for me, took him about an hour. I love that you can fold it up and put it away when not in use, great for small spaces. It is a great workout! It has a small incline and it kicks my butt when I use it. Make sure to hold on.
It is not very sturdy, even after proper assembly. It shakes and shifts with every step. I didn't like that there was next to zero resistance on the band either. It is very compact, which is nice, but it's absolutely unpleasant to use. I returned it. Still waiting for a refund.
"I was not expecting much as this treadmill has no motor, but it works pretty good for the price. My wife uses it daily.
Very well packaged, and arrived in perfect condition. Takes some time to assemble but not too bad. Instructions could be a bit clearer."
It was okay for a manual treadmill. Wasn't super hard to assemble. The tracker device broke after a week. It's always on a slight incline and unless you're looking to go fast and really concentrate on your speed it's not very great to use. I returned it for an electric model.
I purchased for my 12 year old it was on his Christmas list. He is very active and in a few different sports. He LOVES it and so do I. My 10 year old helped me put it together, took about 30 minutes. So easy! It fits his small physique so not sure its a good choice for a large adult, however if you will only use for walking give it a try. Overall 4 stars only because incline is not adjustable.
"Overall, its great. Compact, simple and environmentally friendly.
After a few usage, notice some increase of bell resistance (subtract 1 point). And thus one needs to work a bit harder for walking or jogging on the machine. Not bad, isn't exercise what we want to do?
So, great product."
Treadmill came packaged well and on time. Took about an hour for me and hubby to set up. Gives me a great workout but you do have to hold on while walking. That's how I get my workout, trying not to fall down or off.
Great Treadmill. Great and easy to assemble up . A great workout and way to walk on the treadmill ... Will definitely recommend..
Small, easy to move around, and does what you need it to do. Just understand that manual treadmills are not for running. They simulate walking up a hill but with a slightly different stride.
Since it is manually operated, I would just jump on and start walking while watching TV...no power cords running across the room, no use of electricity.
This item was to be something "akin" to a "Treadmill", instead, I thought a "Tonka Truck" would be following next. This is an item for maybe a little teen that wants to get some exercise during the pandemic
This equipment is solid and better than expected in many ways, but the fixed incline creates a FORCED UPHILL speedwalk that is not great unless you are going for a stairstep-type workout; trying to find a way to adjust to a more normal fastwalk.
If you are using it to WALK only, then its most likely will be fine.... but you have to hold on... if you are planning on running, this is really dangerous. You have to hold on to run... and its not really exercising at that point other than working out maybe your arms?
I bought this because I can't walk in the snow. This is honestly dangerous treadmill. It cast $179.00 and I cannot use it because there's no control on how slow or fast you can go so you slip and fall. I have never written a bad review on a product but honestly, its so much money really non usable.
It was easy to put together. Just four steps. I love this treadmill, in my opinion it's better than the electric. The whole family uses it. Adults and teens. Very satisfied with this product.
I was very looking forward to having this treadmill. Easy to assemble. Great for small space. However the belt is too lose and moving too fast. I would want more resistance, and so I attempted to adjust the belt as instructed. Does not work. Not sure if it has something to do with cracked left side part.
Came in early perfect for what I need excellent smooth belt and will update in few months to let know how it holds up because seeing alot of different reviews but so far definitely 5 stars
Machine was immediately returned after 30 seconds of use. Treadmill is extremely loud and awkward. You also have to hold on to the handles or else you will fall right off. Do not waste your money or time on this machine.
Very easy to fold;just take the knob out of the side while it's on the floor and it folds right up ; Then place knob up in the side to keep it standing up right.Like I said mine came with no instruction,But I figured it out.Thanks.
Not properly repackaged. Oil container cap not on, leaked everywhere. Lip of handlebar jammed on the side footstep and caused minor damage to foam pad of handlebar. Washers missing. Big mess, not sure it was worth the savings.
"Easy to assemble, easy to fold up and put away, easy to use. I think I like it better than electric treadmills......
I put it together by myself in under 1 hour. I'm small and not good with directions, but had no problems."
If you are looking for an inexpensive treadmill for walking only this is the one. It is a bit loud but I was able to take my hair scarf and make it into a basket to put my cellphone in and listen to my music. It's ok until I am able to get back in the gym
"Buyer Beware!
After setting up your treadmill and turning it on, the screen will say ""Go to iFit.Com and register to activate."" It will appear that you need to sign-up for iFit to turn on your treadmill. iFit will ask for your credit card and will start a free trial, after which you will be AUTOMATICALLY charged $15.00 a month.
You can get around registering for iFit, but NordicTrack does not state this anywhere in the manual and the packaging says you cannot start your treadmill before registering with iFit. This is predatory, and I actually think criminal behavior on the part of NordicTrak.
TO GET AROUND THIS SCAM, hold down the iFit logo on the treadmill for 30 seconds and your treadmill will work. I hope this helps people from being forced to give out their credit card and personal information."
I just got my NordicTrack T 6.5 treadmill today. I had it professionally installed. The installer told me that it is impossible to activate the machine unless you go online to ifit to register the product. Once there the wanted me to give all my personal info, give my credit card information, download their app, and signup for ifit that cost $180 per year. The installer convinced me to sign up and said I can cancel anytime during the first month for free. Feeling like I didn't have a choice I went ahead and signed up. After the installer left I decided to go back in and cancel iFit. First I tried to go to their website to cancel and could not find a link anywhere to cancel. Next I tried calling them and got put on hold for 30 minutes. I finally hung up and decide to try their chat. For the next 1/2 hour I kept getting messages saying "Thank you for your patience while we connect you with the next available agent." After a half hour of waiting I decided to try the phone again. After being on hold for another half hour I finally got through they told me they prefer I go online to cancel. When I asked them where the link was to do that he said he wasn't sure. I finally got them to cancel over the phone. It only took about 2 hours all total. I am beginning to think this is a scam and am considering just sending the treadmill back to Amazon.
"I would of given it 4.5 if I could. Let me start by saying that I am more than satisfied with this treadmill. Some people were saying that this treadmill was only good for fast walking or light jogging. This is absolutely inaccurate. The speeds are 1-10 and most of the time I can't even go past 6 for my fast jogging. I also read people saying that you couldn't increase speeds in increments, another inaccuracy, you absolutely can! Incline is very good, solid, and responsive. I feel as if people are trying to knock this perfectly solid treadmill to make way for newer models.
OK, so it doesn't have fans, or TV screen, or a doughnut maker. Really people? Are you here to get a good workout or watch TV? Most of the time I use my phone for music anyway, that way I can have the music blasting in my ear. My basement is perfectly cool for my treadmill and if necessary I could always just put a standing fan in front of it. I agree that the panel speakers suck. Use earphones or your stereo, problem solved.
The cup holders are nice and large to put your keys, watch, socks, if you like running barefooted like an animal, cellphone, or your Big Gulp drink that you got form 7-Eleven.
The panel has plenty of options to keep track of all kinds of stuff. Honestly I only use time, or distance, but I understand it's cool to have little preset workouts and other options. I might want to keep track of how much lard falls of my body one day with the calorie option.
I guess my light humor comes from the fact that I got such a great deal for such great quality and competent treadmill :) ."
I had a tough time deciding on treadmill. I was looking into the 200 price range but every time I read a review they said things like "don't try to run on it" So I kept raising the price range until I found one that I was able to find the qualities I was looking for. I wanted something that you could run at least 10 mph on and had an incline but not a manual one, and also a fold up one because it would have to be placed in the living room. I read a review on this treadmill that convinced me this one was the one. I am 5'2 and 196 lbs. I used to be a runner but then I had kids. Between work, kids and making dinner I found little time to exercise. Now I am so happy I made the choice of buying this treadmill. This treadmill is well made and sturdy. It does not shake when I run and is easily portable. When it was delivered I had to schedule to be there because it needed to be signed off by the delivery company. They brought it into my house in a very large box. It does take 2 people to assemble because someone has to hold the console piece while you connect the one wire. It took about 30 minutes to assemble. My husband did most of it with no difficulties. After plugging into the wall there is a switch at the bottom in the front that turns on the treadmill. The first week I received it I ran 20 miles with a 4.5 mph. No problems so far. I am extremely happy with this purchase.
"I bought this for my mother, it arrived on time. No issues. I paid for the expert installation, which we had no problems. 15 minutes after the technician left, the thing stopped working. Of course I was at work, so when this occurred my mom did not know what to do. She called the tech back and he confirmed he could not figure out why it stopped. Later that evening I stopped by my moms house to see what the story was. Everything seemed to work except the belt. Now I have to call NordicTrack and see when they can send someone out. Amazon, is pretty good about offering solutions as far as returns.
I was given 3 options.
1. Call Norditrack
2. Have a local repair person fix it, and they would refund me $120.00
3. Complete refund on both the unit and shipping (I would assume the 3 year maintenance plan).
I am giving this 1 star because despite some of the good and bad stories, there should be no reason why this thing should have died.
I am hoping I get a quick response tomorrow and we can work from there.
I will update as we go along.
***************UPDATE
So it was initially decided that the motor was broken on the machine by the technician who was dispatched about a week later. It took about 2 weeks to receive another motor. Add a few days to dispatch another tech at this point we are talking almost a month since the machine has arrived. (I was actually contemplating of just doing a return because it was nearing the time to pay the charge on my credit card.) Back to the story, so the tech shows up, we have the new motor, and an excited mom, I then find out that its not the motor, but the control panel. Again back to square one, another 2 weeks for delivery. Again a couple days to dispatch a technician once the part arrived. Tech arrived installed the new control panel and the machine runs, and hasn't had a problem since. Its been working with no issues for about 2 months now. Mom is happy, but I'm not really sure it was worth it. At this point I can't recommend purchasing this unit through this sales channel. Amazon was perfect but I don't know if it is Norditrack, the warehouse who holds this equipment, XPO who ships this equipment, the tech who installed this equipment... bottom line... a product was purchased for over $700 and it didn't work for almost two months from the day the transaction was completed. We weren't given anything for our troubles. Yes we weren't told ""oh well sorry no refunds, all sales are final"", we were offered a refund of $120 if we decided to let Norditrack off the hook and go with a local repair person, but there was nothing saying ""we are sorry for what happened, the month and a half that was lost will be on us"" (the company that failed to delight you as a customer). The only power as a customer is a review, to forewarn others of such an awful experience.
I work in the customer service industry, so I know how hard it can be to please customers. In this case, the product offer and the services to support it were abysmal.
Sincerely,
Sam K."
"Great treadmill! Gets the job done. I had it assembled via Amazon because I didn't want to take any chances on messing it up.
I will say it super squeaky. I'm not sure why. My previous (much cheaper) treadmill didn't squeak. Not really sure what to do to remedy this."
The machine is great and delivery and set up went very smoothly. HOWEVER, the claim of a free 1-year iFit membership is FALSE! After getting the run around from NordicTrack and iFit, I called Amazon Support. Here's the deal: the CUSTOMER PAYS UPFRONT FOR THE ONE YEAR IFIT MEMBERSHIP AND THEN SUPPOSEDLY CAN CANCEL A YEAR LATER AND GET THEIR MONEY BACK! To me, that's a $396 gamble. NO THANKS!!
"I will start with the main reason why you should not buy this treadmill before going into details.
NordicTrack deceptively makes you believe that the treadmill will not work unless you sign up for their iFit program requiring your credit card and other info. The info on how to bypass is not found anywhere in there manuals, their website, youtube or google. Shameful strong arm tactic. After you give them your credit card number then they will tell you to HOLD DOWN THE IFIT BUTTON FOR 30 SECONDS. I found this out after hours of trying to figure out of how to avoid giving them my credit card number.
After I signed up, I called the next day to cancel the subscription and was on hold for 64 minutes before the call was disconnected on their end. The second call , I held for about 50 minutes before I hung up. The 3rd time I called when they first open and held for 15 minutes before someone picked up.
Extremely disappointed that this is Amazon's Choice. Purchased this treadmill based on the fact that is showed Amazon's Choice. Assembly date had to be rescheduled a couple of times, finally came on a Sunday about 4pm. Assembly guy was a good guy, not his fault. He let me know that the cover to the motor was broken. I am now on hold 35 minutes and 52 seconds trying to get a replacement."
"If I could give it a zero I would. I received this machine defective. It will not work. My husband and I assembled the machine exactly how the instructions stated. Its no damn cake walk either. A lot of the parts were built improperly so they did not fit together very well. It took a lot of pressure to get the parts to come together appropriate enough that we could insert the screws. One of the bolts I got was completely welded over the on the head and I could not use it at all. After we got the machine together and went thru the set up process, the machines belt was not moving at all. We called Nordic track customer support he said the control board was bad. SO we waited a week for parts, replaced the board and went thru the setup and calibration process, Still did nothing....Called customer service again, now they are saying its the wire leading from the board to the console.... which means we have to take the entire machine apart and replace the wire and set it up all over again and to be honest they don't even know if that's it... If it isnt that part they send a different part in the mail. If I want a tech to come out I have to wait till he calls me to schedule a day. The whole process takes a week or two. Do this three times and it's just not worth the time and energy. I just paid a lot of money for this machine and here I am rebuilding the whole thing. Nordic tracks customer service and warranty is a joke!!!!! DONT BUY FROM NORDIK TRACK! Here we are with a broken machine due to no fault of our own and no one is willing to get their butts out here to fix it or replace it.
UPDATE: THANKS TO AMAZON IM ABLE TO RETURM THE MACHINE FOR A FULL REFUND. THEY ARE SENDING OUT THEIR DELIVERY GUYS TO COME GET THE MACHINE, I DONT EVEN HAVE TO BOX IT BACK UP! THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!!!!"
This was my first large treadmill purchase and I was a bit reluctant to purchase such a beast of equipment online without first trying it in a store. To add to the excitement, I decided to opt for basic front door delivery with Prime and put this machine together without professional assistance. I ordered the treadmill on a Friday afternoon and received the package the following Tuesday. It was packaged extraordinarily well and arrived on a wood pallet. This thing is HEAVY - but my husband and I were able to move it with minimal issues (moving coasters helped!). As for putting it together, my husband was able to accomplish this in about an hour and a half by himself. He was surprised at how straightforward the assembly was, although quickly admitted that it was definitely a two person job. Once we remembered to put the red magnetic key in the front of the machine, we were in business! This is a very well made piece of equipment that operates beautifully at the highest of inclines and at all available speeds - and it is STURDY. We are very happy with this purchase. Thank you Amazon and NordicTrack!
"THE GOOD:
Easy for 2 people who have put together a lot of you-build-it furniture over the years to assemble and took about 90 minutes.
The belt, motor, and critical mechanical parts appear to be well-made with quality materials. The display console doesn't quite have the same premium feel as the rest of the assembly, but on a machine at this price point I'd rather made tradeoffs there than the mechanical parts.
iFit is a double-edge sword, with half of the experience falling in the ""this is a total game changer"" and the other half falling in the ""this is an unacceptable trainwreck"" category. When you manage to navigate your way through the impenetrable user experience to finally load the workout you were looking for it justifies the price -- the live video instructor-led workouts are phenomenal at this price point.
THE BAD:
You won't actually be able to find this stated anywhere online, but the treadmill has no outputs or bluetooth capability so you're forced to watch everything on the 10"" screen (the S has bluetooth because it doesn't have a screen, but you lose bluetooth with the Si). The 10"" screen is great if you don't have the ability to connect to a larger external monitor, but from the number of questions on this topic it's safe to assume that, like myself, many people want to output the video to a larger screen. Some of the more expensive Nordictracks apparently have this capability, and frankly had I known this I would have purchased a step-up model. It's fine if you don't want to offer this on the economy model, just make sure it's called-out (e.g. ""video output through integrated screen only, no support for external monitors or TV"").
You can't use headphones with iFit workouts and must use the integrated speakers. Non-starter if you're working out when others are sleeping or if you live in a smaller space and don't want to disturb others. Again, it's fine to not offer this, but it needs to be called-out (e.g. ""audio output through integrated speakers only, no support for headphones"")
iFit in general: thousands of confused and angry users have said everything you can possibly say about the terrible iFit user experience: it's doesn't reflect professional commercial software standards for interaction design, lacking even such basic functions as search... it's true, there's no way to search the large library of iFit videos unless you pay some dude who scrapes the content another 30 bucks a year for access to his private database. The lack of search is just the tip of the iceberg though -- iFit is one of the most poorly-designed interactive experiences I've come across in the last few years, falling down at almost every step of the user journey.
iFit people, if you're listening: the actual service you provide is stellar and the quality of the content is exceptional. You're shooting yourselves in both feet by ignoring basic usability, and this has been going on long enough that if you don't get serious about fixing it one of your competitors is going to eat your lunch and steal your users by doing the exact same thing you're doing but actually delivering an experience that works. You've already done the hard stuff, for crying out loud -- the work to get the experience out of the gutter isn't rocket science. Fix it."
Received it and it broke within a week. Nordic sent us a bunch of different parts to fix it but none of them worked and they refused to replace the unit. Out 600 bucks. I cannot say enough to avoid this brand
This is a great machine absolutely ruined by the software. If you dont want to spend $40 a month you are in for a frustrating and infuriating time. I read the mostly positive reviews, and got one. I wish I hadn't. I had no intention of signing up for iFit because it seems gimmicky. The software pushes iFit sign up so hard it makes the machine almost unusable. Please dont make my mistake thinking I could look past the horrible software, you can't. This is an outright scam.
"I am a big guy as you might know from such reviews as my desk chair and many other! Don't know my reviews? ok then I will let that pass this time :) This treadmill will work up to 300lbs so they say. Luckily I am still slightly under that number. This can incline 10 degrees and go up to 10 mph. I trot along between 2 and 4. Really impressed by it and so far, I am not yet aware if it holds my laundry while drying. As most of my exercise equipment in the past has done.
Putting together would be really easy with 2 people. I was in an accident and I don't move around so well and I put it together alone. Hardest part was the underneath bit where you have to put the bars in for holding it up while being stored. However I managed. The thing is a beast and is quite heavy, It does not move on the rug at all while I am using it.
Is it loud? Well yes but no louder then any treadmill I have ever been on. Faster you go, louder it gets. Is it too loud? No!
My only complain is that the video they show the unit is not the same as this one. But the pics they show are the same. if you are thinking of buying this, do it! For its size, it didn't take up as much room as I thought. Here it is wedged between my 2 other machines"
"I usually don't write reviews, but this treadmill absolutely deserves one!
I have had this for a little over a month and I am in love. A few things I think worth noting:
-I have bad knees and the belt on this treadmill doesn't hurt them at all.
-I love the fact that you get an ifit membership free for a year. Having all of those personal trainers and different workouts available in my home makes morning exercising enjoyable (as enjoyable as morning runs can be;)). They really make the runs go by much quicker.
-The sound system on this thing is amazing, my roommates and I actually had a little dance party in the workout room because it sounds so good and connects easily to bluetooth.
- It is beautiful. The screen is a great size and is very high quality. It's honestly a better treadmill than the treadmills at most gyms.
- FANS. ugh having the fans is a game changer for me.
-It has a great range of incline and speed.
I'm 5'5"" and it's the perfect size for me. HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you want a great way to get in shape in your own home. It's very high-quality for an amazing price. It honestly makes me want a NordicTrack Elliptical and whatever else they offer too!"
"SIMPLY PUT - THIS IS A FANTASTIC MACHINE! I'm an avid runner¦ who has run on many treadmills over the years, and this machine is awesome. It has all the features and feel of a gym machine just not as bulky or expensive. It's got a lot of bells and whistles, some of which we are still discovering but probably our favorite are the touch screen display and the bluetooth. Also, it's nice to have a built in speaker and THE FAN! .... This will be GOLD in the summer! Our last treadmill didn't have this and we had to have a ghetto fan rigged up to the machine.
We have a pretty small workout space in our garage where this will live and it fits nicely there and can be more compact using the nice hydraulic fold option. Even our 8 year old daughter can lower and raise the machine by herself. Our whole family is really pleased with this treadmill.
A word about delivery and set-up. Because it's an oversized product, it's not handled by regular amazon delivery. I am always a little leery about the reliability of getting assigned a delivery window, but I will say delivery was prompt and the treadmill arrived within the delivery window as promised. I was not prepared for the size- the box was HUGE! It is a treadmill though so it makes sense. Ha! We chose to assemble ourselves which was a job I passed off to my husband. Self assembly is doable. My husband said the instructions were extremely detailed and there was no problem with assembly as long as you read and follow each step. You'd better give yourself a few hours for set up and an assistant to help hold pieces in place, etc.
I wouldn't hesitate to buy this treadmill. So far, it's a great machine!"
"As for the treadmill itself:
- Assembly was strait-forward (took a little over 3 hours)
- Roomy
- I enjoy the small features like fan and blue-tooth/headphone jack
- Seems solid, I'm 6'/225lbs and don't feel like it's being battered when I run on it.
Now for the bad. IFit is - for lack of a better term - a money-grabbing joke. They needed to figure out how to move a one-time purchase into a 'subscription model' profit generator and this is what they came up with...although all the adverts I get for 'extended warranties' are coming in a close second.
Highlights (or is it lowlights?)
- Free year isn't really 'free' you have to give them a credit card and hope they don't charge you. Even if you don't do this, you still need to make a login to login to your treadmill. Luckily, they don't verify so Farts McKenzie is the actual owner of my treadmill.
- The benefits of the program (pre-programmed workouts) have been available on workout equipment since the late 90's and didn't require a $400 dollar-a-year investment.
- The other benefit (hey it looks like I""m running through mountains!) falls flat when you are staring at an 8'' tablet screen.
I like having a treadmill in my home as I don't have the time to get to a gym. But for spending over a grand I should be able to program a workout, or deal with a small list or preprogrammed workouts. As it is I have to constantly adjust the speed/incline on the fly as I need to.
iFit is a transparent money grab and needs to be put in the garbage. I will not invest in another treadmill with this garbage, I'll suck it up, get a gym membership and make the time to get there. It'd still probably cost under $400 a year."
I had a NordicTrack treadmill for 10 years and used it everyday. When it died of old age, I bought a new one in March. It quit in July, it's now October and 19 emails later NordicTrack still hasn't fixed it. They send parts and links to YouTube videos on how to replace them, but the problem persists. I thought I was buying from a reputable company but I have since looked online and there are dozens of complaints about NordicTrack, this faulty machine, and their very poor service response. There are other companies out there, buy from anyone buy but NordicTrack, they aren't the company they used to be.
"After years of contemplating buying a treadmill but always deciding it wasn't worth the money since I'd rather run outside and had access to them at the gym, I started looking seriously a few weeks ago. The weather in DC is atrocious right now and at 17 weeks pregnant with 3 other little ones, I wasn't able to find the time to run. I saw this deal and HAD to take the chance. The cost was less than 4 months of gym membership when you factor in child care and would allow me to run at home anytime I wanted. I could run or walk during naptime, while the kids played, etc.
I've had it a week and I've used it almost every day. I love it! I can't believe I waited so long to get it! As an avid runner, an athlete and half marathoner this treadmill is perfect. I haven't even used any of the settings yet but the basic machine itself is wonderful (Incline and speed, comfort, etc). Spacious enough to not fall off the back, a wonderful ridge to hold an iPad but still able to see the information display, etc. It's awesome! I see a lot of time spent with it this pregnancy and even in the future once baby #4 is here (running during naps, walking if he won't sleep with him in the ergo, etc). Such a great machine at a great, affordable price."
IFit freezes and crashes constantly - makes it incredibly frustrating to complete a work out. I would Not recommend this product.
"I upgraded from a 10 year old ProForm. This review is in some ways a comparison to that treadmill.
PROS:
Feels very solid and comfortable
Reasonably quiet
Very large running belt
25 year motor warranty
Audio jack & Speakers
Amazon's assembler put this together in 75 minutes
Reasonably priced
CONS:
Requires iFit activation/subscription at a monthly cost to operate treadmill (But See bypass below)
Monochrome Screen (on the 5"" model) is not very good and without any real ""track"" display
No Fan
No ""Resume"" option, if you stop the treadmill for more than a minute, you have to re-start from 0 distance
This is a great treadmill. But it will not work AT ALL if you do not subscribe to iFit (Monthly cost). Fortunately there is a way to bypass the iFit activation (See heading below)
For $20, the treadmill will be delivered to any location of your home. This is a very heavy box that required two pretty big guys to carry (with some difficulty). This is a worthwhile cost if your front door is any appreciable distance from the location where you will be using this treadmill.
I used an Amazon assembler to assemble this (As I write this review, Amazon is offering this $90 service, free). These guys are Pros. He didn't even open the assembly manual and had this fully assembled in 75 minutes or so.
After assembly the treadmill does not work without iFit activation. In fact a red sheet of paper in large letters is included with the assembly manual which says: YOUR TREADMILL IS LOCKED. FINAL ASSEMBLY STEP: GO TO IFIT WEB SITE TO UNLOCK.
My personal opinion is that this a scam. iFit requires a smartphone (what if you don't have one?) and requires giving iFit authorization to deduct the monthly subscription costs directly from your credit card. I believe that the reason the treadmill is so reasonably priced and delivery and installation is free because of the all the money they are making from the iFit subscription. Fortunately, there is a way to operate the treadmill without activating iFit (see below)
HOW TO BYPASS IFIT: There is an iFit Logo button on the display console. After assembly, hold down this button until the Treadmill unlocks (About 20-30 seconds). Sears posts these instructions on their site. I respectfully suggest that Amazon should also consider doing this.
There are two things about the treadmill that felt like a downgrade from my old Proform (although overall this is a much better treadmill). This first is the lack of a fan. The second is the very spartan monochrome display. It's only 5"" big (small) and does not even have a real 1/4 mile track like every other treadmill. It has a really small track (like 1/2 inch) that does not really show your progress. If you like to see your progress on a track while running, skip this model. Nordictrack makes this same model with a much larger (and color) screen but at almost double the cost which is really hard to justify.
The treadmill itself is great. Smooth, solid and reasonably quiet. There are built in speakers and an iphone type audio jack. The running belt is large. Because of the large running area, this treadmill is a bit larger than other models."
Beware before you purchase this treadmill. It's full of glitz and glamour. However, unless you have a dedicated 20amp outlet this treadmill will trip your breaker every time you turn it on. And I had it plugged into a 15 amp breaker with nothing else plugged in. Called NordicTrack. They told me I had to have an ARC filter due to they type of breakers newer homes use. Bought an ARC filter. Still tripped the breaker. Called again. Went through a diagnostic with customer support. Turns out the motor was bad. I had the choice to wait over a week for a technician to come and replace it or they'll send me a new motor in 2 days and I can replace it. I ask will I still need the ARC filter with new motor - yes, I will! $700 for a treadmill that won't work in a modern day home....go figure. Once I get the new motor, I'll update this review.
"I've done a lot of research on treadmills. I've read every single review of this model on Amazon. Yes it took me hours. Now you won't have to.
Let me get the one thing that is constantly mentioned in many previous reviews out of the way. You DO NOT need to sign up for iFit to unlock your treadmill. Just press the blue square iFit button once your treadmill is powered on for about 20 seconds and it will go into manual mode. No need for an iFit subscription.
There is a lot to like about this treadmill (6.5 S model). Wide space for walking and running comfortably. Plenty strong motor. Easy to use buttons. Very bright 5"" screen. Relatively quiet. Two spacious compartments to hold a drink, etc. A thick lip to hold a tablet, magazine, smartphone, etc.
I don't recommend the more pricey 6.5 Si model with the 10"" touch screen unless you absolutely will subscribe to iFit. Otherwise you can use the iFit app on a tablet and sync it with the cheaper 'S' model. (I'm using my treadmill in manual mode.)
There are two things stopping me from giving this treadmill a five star review. One is the way Nordictrack essentially scams you into thinking you need to subscribe to iFit to get your treadmill up and running. (Yes you can cancel before your free month expires, but you need to provide a credit card to subscribe and why put your new customers under such a hassle? Especially when you can bypass all this which by the way isn't even mentioned in the instructions!)
The second issue is with the treadmill 'motor hood' and 'hood accent'. These two pieces are directly in front of your feet as you use the treadmill. Both pieces cover the motor of the treadmill. The issue is that the hood accent is far too close to your feet as you use the treadmill. Looking at the Technogym treadmills at my fancy local gym not a single one has the hood accent as close to your feet. Essentially you will need to use the treadmill probably 6 inches further back then you might normally in order to avoid hitting the hood accent with your feet. I've only seen this issue mentioned in a handful of Amazon reviews, but I'm not sure how more people haven't noticed this. I'm assuming it's a feature you would not find on a pricer treadmill. I'm using my treadmill for casual walking so it's really not a huge issue, but I am making a point to start further back when I use the treadmill, otherwise my feet could easily clip the hood accent. (For reference I'm 6 ft tall. Perhaps less of an issue with shorter people, and even more of an issue with taller people/longer strides.)
You can easily move and store the treadmill by raising from the back and locking into place.
Overall I think this is an excellent choice given the price. I don't see anything better currently in the $600 range. And I've looked at just about every treadmill on the market before my purchase.
Delivery from XPO logistics was no issue. They came to my home and I pointed to the room where I wanted the box left. It's a big and heavy box!
I HIGHLY recommend you have Amazon set up the treadmill. A nice young man came to my home the day after delivery and did it all by himself in about an hour. I tipped him well. Please tip the person that assembles the treadmill. It's not super easy and most people writing reviews said they wish they never tried to do it themselves.
Lastly you definitely should get a mat to place under the treadmill to protect your floor. Countless options are available on Amazon.
Also when I was searching for treadmills Amazon had by far the cheapest price when it came to both purchase and delivery/assembly. I highly recommend you purchase from Amazon if you are going to get any kind of treadmill."
I received the treadmill today and my husband put it together. It is exactly what I was looking for and I'm sure I will be happy with it. Unfortunately, the bottom right rail next to the track is cracked. The box was damaged as well upon receiving but was unable to see the cracked piece until removing all of the contents. I emailed Nordictrack and am notifying Amazon as well and I'm hoping the piece will be replaced and sent out ASAP. Disappointed to receive a new item damaged but should be an easy fix. Otherwise, I'm anxious to start using it.
"The product arrived on time and the xpo delivery people were kind and friendly. This has been one of those rare instances where Amazon was not helpful and has made me reconsider making these types of purchases through their website. While the product arrived in good shape, one of the advertised aspects of this product was FREE in home assembly. I contacted Amazon on 3 separate occasions trying to get help in this regard. They reassured me repeatedly that they would get it taken care of and that free in-home assembly was included; however, no one knew how to help me and they just kept transferring me from department to department. Eventually the home services people called, but just placed me on hold immediately and then hung up.
I was left needing to find a way to move and set up a very heavy treadmill. With some help, it go taken care of...but looking back I wouldn't have purchased the treadmill if I had known that the advertisement for in-home setup is just a ploy that Amazon makes very difficult to make a reality.
The treadmill itself is operating well and seems solid. The controls are not the most advanced, but for the price I feel it is nice. The operation is not noisy at all for a 6'1 175 lbs person and operates smoothly at running speeds. The incline and speed changes (10 speeds with fractional speeds in 10ths) are a great feature and good for this price.
I will update after 6 months. Right now I would say its a decent treadmill and I'm glad to have it; however, the set up experience was deceptive and difficult and a service that was part of the purchase was never instigated by Amazon and never performed after multiple contacts."
"This treadmill has malfunctioned 3 times since I purchased it. When the stop key is pressed, if the treadmill does not stop and I press it again, it still doesn't stop but increases the speed from 3.3 mph (my usual walking speed) to 7 MPH. The first time it happened about 6 weeks ago, I had a friend with me and he pulled the key to stop the machine so I did not fall. The second time it happened was on the 7th of Nov but it was running so fast I couldn't grab the key to stop it and when I did, it stopped but I fell. The last time it happened was yesterday Nov 19th but I was able to pull the stop key before it increased in speed. I did however, see the speed increase on the monitor and it was at 7 mph. Luckily I pulled the key before it sped up. That's when I called customer support and filed this claim.
This machine is extremely dangerous and needs to be remedied. I want a safe treadmill and not one that will kill me before my time.
I have filed an injury claim with the Icon legal team and it is being reviewed and they will look into some options to remedy this problem."
"With COVID here for the winter and no access to our gym, we decided it was time for a treadmill. Our needs are pretty basic - the treadmill has to be able to handle two people running 5k about three times a week. I'm a 200lbs 6' guy, and while I don't run fast I do a bit more than jogging. Cheaper treadmills get too wobbly or bouncy at anything beyond a jog. Not this one! The T6.5S does just as well as the one at the gym as far as I'm concerned. The only difference is that the track is a bit more narrow, but it's plenty wide for our needs.
Assembly was pretty easy, or so my wife tells me - she put it together almost all by herself (there were a couple parts that are easier with two people). Our only hitch was that after it was all assembled, we couldn't get the panel beyond the ""register at iFit"" screen. We thought we didn't connect the panel properly or something, but after taking some things apart and putting them back together we realized we just needed to attach the safety key. Duh! This was our fault as it does mention this in the instructions. Still, an error message like ""attach safety key"" would have been nice versus an ambiguous ""BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP"" error.
Now - this is all pretty complimentary, so why one star? It's all about the digital ecosystem. This treadmill has bluetooth, which gives it the capability to sync detailed workout stats. However, this feature is 100% worthless due to intentional choices made by Nordictrack and iFit. Bluetooth stat syncing ONLY works with the iFit app. The iFit ecosystem does not integrate with any other ecosystem, like Apple HealthKit, FitBit, Google Fit, etc. The only ways to get your workout stats into those ecosystems are to either 1) input them manually, or 2) do a cumbersome export/import process, every time. This is ridiculous for a treadmill that essentially has this feature built in but intentionally disabled.
So to our friends at Nordictrack, if you read this: please reevaluate your partnership with iFit. I understand that everyone wants a recurring revenue model. I understand that Peleton is super successful with theirs. It's totally fine to offer a subscription service for live and on demand workouts. I like the model of offering on an iPad app for that purpose versus requiring a more expensive piece of equipment with an extra touch screen. What is totally NOT FINE is requiring a $15 per month PER PERSON subscription just to sync your workout data.
And to our friends at iFit - you are getting the business model wrong. The correct model is to offer a free basic service with a fee based premium service. The free service really needs to do little more that store workout data and offer an API to sync them with other ecosystems. I understand you do not even have this capability today on the paid service. This is almost certainly an intentional decision, but let me be clear: you will never a dominant health ecosystem using only proprietary devices. You just won't. I have no interest in switching all my health hardware to any single vendor. I have no desire to be forced to use your iFit fitness tracker instead of my FitBit or Apple Watch. And you will never keep up with all possible device categories - you don't even have a connected scale. What about sleep monitors? Posture trackers? Blood pressure monitors? Stop. Just let your ecosystem integrate with others like every other successful health company ends up doing.
OF NOTE: Previous negative reviews were upset that the seemingly ""required"" iFit activation also required you to input a credit card number to bill you for the monthly service unless you remember to cancel. This is NO LONGER THE CASE - the iFit trial registration does not require a credit card, and you can still bypass the whole thing by holding down the iFit button for 15 seconds. So, this is not what I'm upset about. I'm upset that I would need to pay $15/month/person to use the bluetooth, and even if I did pay I would have to use the iFit app exclusively to track my health data.
In conclusion - if you just want a solid treadmill with no digital features, this is a great choice. If you want something that integrates with the rest of your digital heath data, look elsewhere."
DO NOT BUY THIS.!!! This treadmill was to come with one year ifit plan. To activate said plan you have to put in a charge card well ifit charged my card 396.00 and now I've been waiting 1hr (2 different times) min for someone to pick up the phone to ask why they charged my card . (update) Nordic Trac contacted me and argued with me that iFit was available and then transferred me to the same number that I waited on last time, Nordic Trac customer service is a joke! Should of gone with Rebox like my old one, I am replacing. If you want headaches, order this treadmill.
We received this machine this morning. I was curious to see what type of delivery we were going to get as it was free with my prime membership, but the delivery guys even brought it downstairs for us (It weighs over 200 lbs), so I wouldn't hesistate to use Amazon again. I still need to figure out how the iFit works on this machine as it was included in the elliptical we have along with wifi connectivity, but as far as a treadmill goes, it works great. Assembly did take a while, but we were being very cautious throughout the process. Make sure you have a good ratchet set because the provided hex key would have been brutal to do manually. Using my ratchet set, I was able to make sure everything was nice and tight. Also, follow the directions carefully. There is a reason they tell you not to tighten the screws all the way sometimes. Oh and don't forget, like any workout equipment, the machine won't turn on until you put the magnetic key in (with the safety strap). I quickly realized that after I plugged it in and the screen turned on and then turned off. We gave it a quick test run so far and the incline works, speeds seem good, it tracks all of the information you expect from a treadmill. We haven't tried the MP3 input jack yet for music, but we have a TV in front of the unit, so I'm not sure how much we will utilize the speakers anyway. The cup/bottle holders on each side are nice. It folds up nicely and the provided pump ensures that it unfolds smoothly and won't come crashing down on your feet if it slips out of your hands. We plan to get the extended service plan just in case any of the parts go within the first few years (its included in the directions), but it seems pretty solid and I don't anticipate any issues. If I do, I will be sure to update my review.
"I ordered this treadmill a few weeks ago and it was delivered last week. I paid $20 extra to have Amazon delivery (subcontracted) move it to the room of my choice which was the best $20 I have ever spent. Why? This thing is sturdy and not the short average online order treadmill. This is full length gym size. Not sure what the description review says but it weighed about 250 pounds and was in a 7 foot box.
I assembled it in about 2 hours (should have been one but I was distracted by Game of Thrones re-runs). There were some steps that were a bit hard to see on the instructions but in general it was not tough at all. Early feedback:
- The treadmill is sturdy, doesnt bounce around and fairly quiet for a treadmill
- The handles and design are good and well made
- The screen is a tad small but works fine
- The iFit login is a bit annoying every time but maybe I can figure out how to bypass that
- The incline and acceleration buttons and features are easy to use and slick
- Love the built in fan and bluetooth
- Some of the plastic molding is a bit wonky to snap into place as you build it so if it doesnt look right just keep at it, they eventually will pop into place
All in all we are really happy with this. The alternative was a $3500 gym treadmill and I think we made a great purchase. Will amend if something pops off tonight, besides my knee."
"In the early 90s - about 25 years ago, I bought a NordicTrack treadmill - for around $2,000. Recently, I decided we needed one with a shorter ramp because we're running out of space and spot where I wanted to put it - was about 2 inches too short. And one day while running on the old machine, I looked back at how much ramp space there was behind my feet that I wasn't using and wondered if anyone made a shorter treadmill now. The ramp on the old machine was like 6 feet long and I really only used the first 3-4 feet of it.
I went on Amazon and looked them up and sure enough, to my delight, they make shorter ones now!
Since my old one had lasted so long (even though it didn't really get much use!), I decided to go with another NordicTrack despite several negative and disturbing reviews.
I was very happily surprised to see these things selling for around $600 now! But I figured the quality will be worse or it will have fewer features. When we received it and got it all set up - I was amazed that the quality was as high as it was on the $2,000 machine and happy to see it had all the same features. The funny thing is - it literally has exactly the same features. They're just laid out and displayed in a different way. The buttons for speed and incline are easier to press and far more attractive to look at.
The center screen that supposedly has workout programs that you can follow - I find to be totally useless. I just use it to monitor my progress... how many minutes, how much distance I've done, etc. But if it has some workout programs in it - it's not instantly obvious how to access them, so I haven't bothered. I don't care enough about that feature to worry about it.
The really nice thing about this newer version is that when you want to put the ramp up (Do they call it a ramp? Anyway, the thing your feet touch when you're running on it), when you put it up - you can literally do it with the touch of a finger. You just barely lift it - it's like lifting a 5 pound weight... and the hydraulics take care of the rest.
When you put it down, you unlock it and then just let go of it and it will settle down to the floor very gently on its own. You don't have to lift or hold any weight at all when you put it back down. On the 25-year-old machine - that thing was seriously heavy and you had to have some real strength to lift it up and down. Which was fine except it was a little scary - what if you drop it? And over the intervening 25 years, my back isn't exactly what it used to be! So it was actually a bit of a problem for my back. So, this new model is really awesome in this respect.
We also bought the $95 assembly package. The guy who came out was awesome. He put it together in about 45 minutes. The thing was a big complicated mess right out of the box. If I had attempted it - I'm not even sure if I could have finished it. But if I could have, I am sure it would have taken at least a week! So, the $95 was well worth it. Oh and by the way, keep in mind Amazon doesn't really pay these guys all that well. Amazon takes 40% of that fee. Why? I don't know... because they're not doing any of the work or incurring any of the travel expenses. They really should give these guys 90% of it. So we left him a good tip. We knew it had taken him an hour to get to us from the last place he was. So, for Amazon to pay him just $57 for what amounted to 2 hours of work we didn't really think was fair.
All in all I'm very happy with it. It's not only every bit as good - but it's even better - than the old machine that cost 3x more 25 years ago."
"I bought this model 6.5 S on purpose because it said it was compatible with the iFit... I was aware of a monthly iFit subscription of $9.99 a month for 2 years totalling $220 upfront ... however there is no true compatibility and this machine requires an extra iFit module to be purchased for $150...
Very misleading in the pictures and the info. Wouldnt have purchased this if was really clear it would take another $350 just to have the iFit work on this machine. Be aware."
"Without question, there are better and more advance treadmills out there but for the price of this one, you can't beat it. I'm a runner, regularly training for marathons and I feel content saying this treadmill is everything you could need unless you are a competitive sub-6 minute mile runner. I've been using this treadmill for about a month and a half, mostly so I could get runs in with a newborn at home and I haven't been disappointed in any way. I've seen a lot of home treadmills that look very fragile but this one is solid; i'm 180 lbs and run hard and even at various inclines, this thing is a rock. I'm not scared that its going to break or fall apart. I haven't really played with the various training programs built in since I've been following my own running plan but there are quite a few and they do auto-adjust pace and incline which is nice.
I elected to put it together myself and it's rather simple, I had the whole thing together and running in maybe an hour? With it being such a sturdy treadmill, it is very heavy. I had it delivered directly into my garage and took everything out of the box there and then moved it piece by piece down to my basement. Most individual pieces are very light except for the running deck/track. I actually did it on my own using a handtruck but I DO NOT recommend doing it with out at least one other person. I was inpatient and couldn't wait for a friend to come and slowly moved the deck down step by step...
My only complaint, which is hardly a complaint since I didn't order it for this feature, is the ""speakers."" There is a 3mm input for your phone or tablet but the speakers are a joke... If you don't care about sound quality, then maybe they're ok but I'd recommend your own headphones. I did mount a TV to the wall in front of the treadmill (with FireTV) which when running at a fast pace, needs to have the volume turned up because the motor is a bit loud (but I don't feel any louder than an average treadmill).
If you're in the market for a treadmill and don't want to spend thousands, this is the one.. especially since Amazon offersfree shipping.. which for something over 200lbs, I feel is a deal."
"I don't need a lot of fancy stuff on my treadmill, so I was looking at the cheaper ones to replace the one I had for about 5 years that cracked one day while I was jogging. However, that treadmill went to a 10% incline and 10mph, and once I noticed that the cheaper ones only went to 7/7.5 on those measures, I moved up to this price range.
I was immediately frustrated that I was REQUIRED to sign up for iFit to use the treadmill. ARE YOU KIDDING??? Fortunately, the installer (my order came with free installation) told my son a fantastic tip to what I guess he heard as a common complaint. if you hold down the iFit logo on the console for 15-30 seconds, you can bypass the opening screen and actually use the console/treadmill. It is ABSOLUTELY ASININE that Nordic Track attempts to force buyers to sign up with iFit. I can't tell how much of a major turn off that is.
PROS
- 10% incline and 10 mph
- Once you figure out how to bypass the initial console screen demanding an iFit registration, console is pretty easy to use (though instructions are scant on the buttons immediately below the screen, and what instructions there were were not consistent with the screen's behavior)
- Unit ""appears"" sturdy but only time will tell
- 20 built-in exercise routines, though I am a 'manual workout' person myself
CONS:
- See iFit comment above. ASININE, ABSURD, RIDICULOUS
- Plastic protector at head of running board is about 3 inches too close to my feet, so I occasionally land on it while jogging. Yes, I like to hold the rails and interact with the controls while running. This was also an issue on my last treadmill.
- The cupholders are plastic and thus quite noisy with a plastic bottle or remote control on them. Come on, for $600 you could afford a little felt. I had to insert my own felt to cut down on the ridiculous noise.
- The side bars and pulse bars are about 6 inches too low for me (I am 6 feet tall). They are almost ok at zero incline, but at 7% incline, it is uncomfortable. I have to stoop over to use the pulse bars. Again, for $600, it seems like it would have been extremely easy to make the console/side bars adjustable so everyone could be comfortable.
- There is no 'pause' button. You must hit 'stop' and after some indeterminate relatively short time, the console will reset.
- When I use the pulse monitor and the reading appears, often it intermittently returns, overtaking the calorie reading, and I haven't figured out how to get that to stop.
- Pulse monitor is erratic and does not seem to give consistent, accurate readings.
- See comments above re: screen settings
- No control buttons (e.g., speed/incline) on hand rails
- The incline does not return to zero after you are finished. This is actually quite shocking. You have to hit zero to return it to flat before powering off
- Console does not power off unless you remove the emergency key; there is no 'off' button for the console.
- Instructions tell you to power off AND unplug the machine after every workout!!! Or it will shorten the life of the unit!!! Really?!?! Fortunately, the power off button is very small and near the floor. Why not actually put it where it's easy to reach if it's so vital??? Does anybody think about how to best design a treadmill before they build it?"
This purchase has been a disaster from day one. First, it took a month for it to get delivered. Now a month into using the thing and it stops after five minutes of use. Of course this started after the return period lapsed. Now I'm trying to get a hold of the company that handles the warranty and I haven't heard a peep in two weeks. So I just got myself a big ol' hunk of junk that I use to hang my purse on.
I thought I would buy this for the convenience of rolling out of bed and doing cardio. In only three months of irregular use the belt comes off and gets twisted up as per photo.
This review is specifically for setup. As many others have complained about NordicTrack really goes above and beyond to try to scam customers with the iFiT subscription. I paid through Amazon to have my treadmill assembled for me. The tech left the treadmill with all the notices on the display to activate iFiT in order for the treadmill to function. The treadmill will literally be locked and unable to operate. I had already read reviews stating that this could be bypassed by holding down the iFIT button for a few seconds. The tech claimed that the company must have disabled this feature and showed me that holding it down wasn't working. He told me I would have to sign up and then left without the treadmill operating. After a few hours of reading through the manual, going on the website, and trying to connect to both Amazon and NordicTrack customer service with no luck I finally found one random review that mentioned the Safety key/cord. Holding down the iFIT icon will only bypass the subscription if the Safety key is in place. Well mine was no where to be found! I went out to the trash and found it in the packaging at the bottom of the trash that the tech had offered to remove. I really have to wonder if it had been thrown out intentionally. As soon as I put the key in place I was able to bypass iFIT and operate the treadmill in manual. Shame on NordicTrack for misleading customers with a forced subscription and for not making it clear in the manual or customer support info that it is not required. I will be thinking twice before purchasing a NordicTrack product!!
Overall a very good product. Be aware that it is huge and heavy, however. Ideally, assemble it where you plan to keep it. It doesn't fit through doors easily- certainly not with one person moving it.
"Not listed on this web page are the warranty requirements. A friend stopped by while it was being delivered, and after discussing his experience I learned some surprising details after confirming it with NordicTrack support.
1) This treadmill must be placed in a climate controlled room. If it's used in the garage your warranty is void.
2) It can't get warmer than 85 degrees while upright. This will stretch the belt, and void your warranty. This is a problem for people like me who go on vacation during the summer, and turn off the A/C while I'm gone (in a triple digit climate).
3) This treadmill requires a dedicated circuit. If not, your warranty is void. After hearing it needed a climate controlled room, I figured I'd put it in my office, until I learned that room has a single circuit for all the outlets (like most bedrooms do). An electrician offered to run a dedicated outlet for $400. YMMV.
My friend had his NordicTrack warranty voided when the motor died 10 months into ownership. The service guy had a long list of reasons why they can void the warranty. Make sure you know the fine print because repairing a broken treadmill can be expensive.
Given this information that isn't mentioned anywhere in this description, I've decided to return the unit. It's not worth the total cost and inconvenience of meeting the unmentioned warranty requirements."
"Two of the main reasons I bought this item was because it had the Google Maps app that would allow me to walk some of my favorite roads across the country and I also liked this unit because I wanted an integrated heart-rate monitor.
When I assembled and turned on the treadmill I found that to activate my FREE iFit account (That includes Google Maps) I would need to supply Nordicktrack with a credit card number so that they could automatically bill it for $395 a year later as a renewal fee of my iFit membership.
With all the stolen and hacked personal information going on everywhere, I don't give my credit card information to ANYONE who does not absolutely need it. I tried calling Nordicktrack to explain that I had ZERO intention of ever renewing my membership with them and just wanted the free year that I was promised but after being on hold for over 20 minutes without speaking to a real person I hung up.
As far as the heart rate monitor is concerned it is totally worthless. The numbers jump around like crazy. One second my rate is 109, then it's 131 and then it's 43. The longer you hold onto the inputs the more numbers you get and they never stabilize. Luckily I have my Fitbit tracker on so I know my true heart rate. Still, I paid for an integrated monitor on the treadmill and it is worthless.
So instead of walking my favorite roads on Google Maps, I bought a 32"" TV and hung it on the wall in front of the treadmill and instead of a heart rate monitor on the treadmill, I wear a Fitbit. Essentially what I have is a $1,000, vintage 1989 treadmill, which in all fairness seems sturdy and solid, but the bottom line is I definitely would not have bought this model or this brand if I knew then what I know now. Buyer Beware."
I really love this treadmill. I paid the extra $20 to have them deliver it to the basement - WELL worth it. I assembled it by myself, which took a few hours over 2 nights. It wasn't the easiest to do, but it is certainly doable by one person. Also, don't believe the nonsense requiring you to sign up for iFit. It is BS. I bypassed it using the instructions another reviewer left and it worked like a charm. Here they are: "HOW TO BYPASS IFIT: There is an iFit Logo button on the display console. After assembly, hold down this buttonuntil the Treadmill unlocks (About 20-30 seconds). Sears posts these instructions on their site."
"I picked this treadmill for two reasons: reviews of the previous version (6.5S) said it was built for running (not just walking), and I wanted the 10-inch screen and accompanying iFit workouts because I tend to get bored. It took two people about 2.5 hours to assemble. One wire wasn't where it was supposed to be and thank goodness for small hands, because I had to reach into the panel and fish it out. I'm new to treadmills, so I don't know how loud it is compared to other machines, but it's louder than I'd hoped. In order to hear the trainer talking (over the motor and my own panting), I have to turn up the volume pretty high -- to a point where the speakers crackle sometimes. Overall the music track is too loud and the trainer track is too soft. Other than that, I have no complaints about the machine.
I view the iFit programs/membership as a big part of this product (and the price), and I adore them. The iFit website is hard to navigate: they have so much amazing content, but it can be hard to find the type and level of workout you want. I started with the ""true beginner"" Antarctica series to get used to using a treadmill, and kept with it even though it was maybe too easy for me just because I enjoyed it so much. I'm also VERY grateful for the Iberian Beginner Running Series, which eases you (back?) into running without overdoing it and getting hurt.
This was a huge splurge for me, but one I'm glad I made."
I bought this treadmill in place of a gym membership because I find it extra hard to leave the house in the winter to make it to the gym. This has been a great solution for our family- even my husband likes to get on and go for a walk before work which makes it all worth it. The ifit program is awesome. You can work with a trainer in a gym doing high impact cardio or go for a hike through alps; love the versatility and variety of programs. Much more motivating to have an instructor guiding you through a workout than a traditional walk/run on a treadmill. The touch screen is great, sound is ample and I love the Bluetooth function to stream my own music. Easy to use and has everything you need to keep your work out comfortable. It is like having a nice gym caliber treadmill at home. The machine is not too loud and belt runs smooth. Cannot say enough about the quality. I will say this - setting it up was a workout in itself - have a good set of pliers as the bolts are a bit tricky. So worth the investment.
Bought the treadmill like 3-4 months ago and it started making noises two weeks ago. Contacted Nordic Track and they told me I need to buy a warranty because I don't have one. Treadmill is making loud grinding noises and is impossible to use but instead of fixing it, Nordictrack is trying to push and expensive warranty on me and even then I don't know if with their "great" customer service they'll actually do anything to fix this. I was under the impression that there was a year long warranty on the treadmill already. Never buying another Nordictrack treadmill in my life never mind the fact that I don't know what to do now. I have an expensive broken down treadmill and no one to help fix it.
Unfortunately I have to send this back. I had the guy come to assemble and once he opened it all up there was a hole in the belt. I waited over a month to get it. Very disappointed. The treadmill it self looks well made and nice but due to the damage I have to send back and again it's out of stock. Although Amazon was very helpful with getting me a refund it's a bummer that I still have no treadmill. What a pain!
Ok. Before I bought this machine. I read all reviews and I was scared of this investment. I'm a body builder and cardio is part of my life style. I wanted to make sure that this is the right one for me. I been using this treadmill for 2 days and so far it's amazing. Assembly toke me 1.5 hr. Nothing hard and all hardware and parts arrived perfect shape. Now In regard to I fit and set up. Man don't stress or sign up for anything. Just once you turn the power on, hold press i fit button for 20 second and boom it will start all programs and you won't have to worry about it. Don't sign up or nothing. If you looking to maintain or lose weight. Get this treadmill. its worth the money. As far as the motor I'll keep update later if I have any issue. Get your 3 years warranty. You need it too. Be safe everyone
Product was damaged in the box. Motor housing and incline hydraulics damaged. Nordic Track lost our registration, even though we received a confirmation email from them, which evidently had the wrong model and serial numbers listed. Nordic Track has been unable to resolve the issue for us, so we have a useless, defective treadmill sitting in the room. How appalling.
I received this new treadmill with broken motor hood on 11/26/2018. I contacted Amazon, then NordicTrack support. I made too many calls, chats. I even registered my treadmill with NordicTrack and created a new support order to report the broken hood. Today is December 19, 2018, I have not received any response. What kind of company is that? Sale the product with all warranties and run away?
"This review is for the NordicTrack T 6.5 Si Treadmill + 1 Year iFit Membership (WORTH IT!) with the 10-inch screen.
I have owned this treadmill for 5 months 1 day as of the current date/writing of this review (May 9, 2020).
This is the first treadmill I have ever owned (I actually bought it as a gift to my girlfriend) and it has been awesome! She loves it too, of course.
Assembly: 4/5 - The assembly was interesting, to say the least, but with the help of my girlfriend, it took us between an hour or two to finish. I'm pretty sure it was much closer to two hours. I do not think it is possible to assemble by yourself but kudos to you if you manage to get it assembled on your own. Then again, try it by yourself and you'll be so worked up from not having an extra 30 pairs of hands to help that you'll be ready to run 30 miles when it's all said and done. I personally would not recommend it, though. You, in some instances, need someone to hold the upper half of the frame while the other is screwing stuff in to anchor it all together. I mentioned the assembly was interesting earlier in the sense of how everything eventually came together so perfectly. There's always one or two small hiccups with getting a screw hole to align...maybe it is just me but that seems to always be expected when I put anything together. I do recall having a slight issue where some wires on the right-hand side needed to be tucked away. I think we were able to rig it so they stayed put so no real big issues there - they are actually run through/inside the right bar that stands vertically touching the floor. The only bar connecting the bottom of the treadmill to the top...it's maybe at a slight 20-degree angle. Anyways, those particular wires are used to connect either the speakers, monitor, or both. Either way, you have to have them. I rate the instructions and everything assembly related a 4/5 deducting one star because you need a second person. As far as how well written the instructions goes and the lack of wtf's that DIDN'T happen, much (which is good by the way), I rate that a 5/5.
Quality: 5/5 - I personally think the quality of the treadmill, build materials, the built-in 10 inch screen, speakers, and any other random odds and ends to be pretty good quality. There is a lot of plastic but it all feels solid and sturdy and should last for many, many years to come.
Noise: 5/5 - I think the noise is about as quiet as you can make a treadmill. Then again, if you're running in place on something suspended off the ground then there are bound to be thuds with each step...I speak from firsthand experience. The speakers get quite loud so that's good noise if you are playing music or watching some of the iFit videos which will be discussed further down but not TOO far in-depth since I want to keep my review specifically on the treadmill itself. Yes, I realize iFit is more...fit...to be in the feature section below yet here it is. :)
Features: 4.5/5 - If you want some good bells and whistles without dropping three grand on a Ferrari-like treadmill this is absolutely more than enough. Especially if you're like me and have never owned a treadmill before. It is a 10-speed treadmill with 10 levels of incline that increment from being flat (0.0) all the way to (45-degree angle upwards maybe?)10.0 at 0.1 increments. The iFit membership I think is stunning! Running in another country or hillside with a trainer all while enjoying the scenery (don't wimp out on monitor size or this is less enjoyable) while getting a good workout makes using this treadmill so much more enjoyable/pleasant. I'm not sure what the little orange/yellow cushion things are called but they are there as support for your joints. When you land, from jogging or running, they squish down to reduce the impact on your knees and other joints. I thought they looked silly but now that I know how well they work and what they are for I don't think they are so funny anymore. The other features you can more easily see from viewing the posted pictures. Cupholders, how big the speakers are, buttons, other little knickknacks. I have not had to use the folding feature of the treadmill to ""tuck"" it away in a corner but I did enjoy playing with the feature when putting it together. I have only used it honestly like 2-3 times and from what I could tell it works well. I do like that there is a ""no slam"" feature where if when you are letting it down and it slips it won't come crashing down. It will catch itself and slowly lower itself down automagically safe and sound...so that's neat. I docked half a point because the heartbeat sensor(s) you put your hands on don't really work all that well. I don't expect them to be 100% perfect or accurate by any means but I found that I have to, more of than not, situate my hands jusssst the right way for it to start giving me a readout. No biggie for me personally, since I have a Fitbit watch, but for anyone out there who is curious...it doesn't work very well for me personally. You might not have any issues with yours but I do with mine. Again, no deal-breaker for me by any means.
iFit Membership: 5/5 - This I am going to briefly touch on and recommend everyone visit the NordicTrack website under the iFit section. I would post a link but I don't know if Amazon filters those out or not so I'll leave it up to you to learn your way around google. There is a TON of information there if you are interested for more information. Our purchase included the 1-year free iFIt membership. I am pretty certain that alone is a $300 value. What I like about it the most is that my girlfriend and I have created our own accounts and can share the membership. This way I can track my workouts and she can track hers on our own unique accounts. Logging in and out is pretty seamless (couple touches and you're logged in). I believe once you login once it doesn't log you out automatically so it's a matter of swapping accounts based on who is about to workout. You can keep track of things such as what days we worked out on, what workout we did, for how long, calories burned, and a LOT more. The membership is honestly a really great idea though. Just make sure you have your treadmill somewhat close to your modem or router (for Internet). Like most things nowadays...the videos need to be streamed while you are viewing them. Aka, you need to be online and connected to the Internet. So be aware of your placement when deciding where to put your treadmill.
I hope this review has helped anyone on the fence as to what they want for their next treadmill.
Happy treading!"
"I've had it since January and it's been working fine until the Firmware was updated this week. Now I just get a loading screen and can't use it when trying to do an activity. When trying to see if a newer firmware is available it is stuck on ""checking for update"".
Update: I wasn't able to find information on online how to do a Factory Reset, but I found it at the top of the machine.
Factory Reset Steps:
Turn off the machine
Get a paperclip and push it in the hole as seen in the pictures
Turn on the power with your foot or a second person, but keep the paperclip held in
Take out the paperclip after you see it updating (see picture)"

Product was damaged in the box. Motor housing and incline hydraulics damaged. Nordic Track lost our registration, even though we received a confirmation email from them, which evidently had the wrong model and serial numbers listed. Nordic Track has been unable to resolve the issue for us, so we have a useless, defective treadmill sitting in the room. How appalling.
I received this new treadmill with broken motor hood on 11/26/2018. I contacted Amazon, then NordicTrack support. I made too many calls, chats. I even registered my treadmill with NordicTrack and created a new support order to report the broken hood. Today is December 19, 2018, I have not received any response. What kind of company is that? Sale the product with all warranties and run away?
"This review is for the NordicTrack T 6.5 Si Treadmill + 1 Year iFit Membership (WORTH IT!) with the 10-inch screen.
I have owned this treadmill for 5 months 1 day as of the current date/writing of this review (May 9, 2020).
This is the first treadmill I have ever owned (I actually bought it as a gift to my girlfriend) and it has been awesome! She loves it too, of course.
Assembly: 4/5 - The assembly was interesting, to say the least, but with the help of my girlfriend, it took us between an hour or two to finish. I'm pretty sure it was much closer to two hours. I do not think it is possible to assemble by yourself but kudos to you if you manage to get it assembled on your own. Then again, try it by yourself and you'll be so worked up from not having an extra 30 pairs of hands to help that you'll be ready to run 30 miles when it's all said and done. I personally would not recommend it, though. You, in some instances, need someone to hold the upper half of the frame while the other is screwing stuff in to anchor it all together. I mentioned the assembly was interesting earlier in the sense of how everything eventually came together so perfectly. There's always one or two small hiccups with getting a screw hole to align...maybe it is just me but that seems to always be expected when I put anything together. I do recall having a slight issue where some wires on the right-hand side needed to be tucked away. I think we were able to rig it so they stayed put so no real big issues there - they are actually run through/inside the right bar that stands vertically touching the floor. The only bar connecting the bottom of the treadmill to the top...it's maybe at a slight 20-degree angle. Anyways, those particular wires are used to connect either the speakers, monitor, or both. Either way, you have to have them. I rate the instructions and everything assembly related a 4/5 deducting one star because you need a second person. As far as how well written the instructions goes and the lack of wtf's that DIDN'T happen, much (which is good by the way), I rate that a 5/5.
Quality: 5/5 - I personally think the quality of the treadmill, build materials, the built-in 10 inch screen, speakers, and any other random odds and ends to be pretty good quality. There is a lot of plastic but it all feels solid and sturdy and should last for many, many years to come.
Noise: 5/5 - I think the noise is about as quiet as you can make a treadmill. Then again, if you're running in place on something suspended off the ground then there are bound to be thuds with each step...I speak from firsthand experience. The speakers get quite loud so that's good noise if you are playing music or watching some of the iFit videos which will be discussed further down but not TOO far in-depth since I want to keep my review specifically on the treadmill itself. Yes, I realize iFit is more...fit...to be in the feature section below yet here it is. :)
Features: 4.5/5 - If you want some good bells and whistles without dropping three grand on a Ferrari-like treadmill this is absolutely more than enough. Especially if you're like me and have never owned a treadmill before. It is a 10-speed treadmill with 10 levels of incline that increment from being flat (0.0) all the way to (45-degree angle upwards maybe?)10.0 at 0.1 increments. The iFit membership I think is stunning! Running in another country or hillside with a trainer all while enjoying the scenery (don't wimp out on monitor size or this is less enjoyable) while getting a good workout makes using this treadmill so much more enjoyable/pleasant. I'm not sure what the little orange/yellow cushion things are called but they are there as support for your joints. When you land, from jogging or running, they squish down to reduce the impact on your knees and other joints. I thought they looked silly but now that I know how well they work and what they are for I don't think they are so funny anymore. The other features you can more easily see from viewing the posted pictures. Cupholders, how big the speakers are, buttons, other little knickknacks. I have not had to use the folding feature of the treadmill to ""tuck"" it away in a corner but I did enjoy playing with the feature when putting it together. I have only used it honestly like 2-3 times and from what I could tell it works well. I do like that there is a ""no slam"" feature where if when you are letting it down and it slips it won't come crashing down. It will catch itself and slowly lower itself down automagically safe and sound...so that's neat. I docked half a point because the heartbeat sensor(s) you put your hands on don't really work all that well. I don't expect them to be 100% perfect or accurate by any means but I found that I have to, more of than not, situate my hands jusssst the right way for it to start giving me a readout. No biggie for me personally, since I have a Fitbit watch, but for anyone out there who is curious...it doesn't work very well for me personally. You might not have any issues with yours but I do with mine. Again, no deal-breaker for me by any means.
iFit Membership: 5/5 - This I am going to briefly touch on and recommend everyone visit the NordicTrack website under the iFit section. I would post a link but I don't know if Amazon filters those out or not so I'll leave it up to you to learn your way around google. There is a TON of information there if you are interested for more information. Our purchase included the 1-year free iFIt membership. I am pretty certain that alone is a $300 value. What I like about it the most is that my girlfriend and I have created our own accounts and can share the membership. This way I can track my workouts and she can track hers on our own unique accounts. Logging in and out is pretty seamless (couple touches and you're logged in). I believe once you login once it doesn't log you out automatically so it's a matter of swapping accounts based on who is about to workout. You can keep track of things such as what days we worked out on, what workout we did, for how long, calories burned, and a LOT more. The membership is honestly a really great idea though. Just make sure you have your treadmill somewhat close to your modem or router (for Internet). Like most things nowadays...the videos need to be streamed while you are viewing them. Aka, you need to be online and connected to the Internet. So be aware of your placement when deciding where to put your treadmill.
I hope this review has helped anyone on the fence as to what they want for their next treadmill.
Happy treading!"
"I've had it since January and it's been working fine until the Firmware was updated this week. Now I just get a loading screen and can't use it when trying to do an activity. When trying to see if a newer firmware is available it is stuck on ""checking for update"".
Update: I wasn't able to find information on online how to do a Factory Reset, but I found it at the top of the machine.
Factory Reset Steps:
Turn off the machine
Get a paperclip and push it in the hole as seen in the pictures
Turn on the power with your foot or a second person, but keep the paperclip held in
Take out the paperclip after you see it updating (see picture)"
"I am 218 pounds and 5'10. It shakes a little when I am on it. The handrails are a bit short and the front plate should be further up so people that want to stand really close to the console are able to do so without stepping on it and tripping.
All that said I love this treadmill. I personally feel it is sturdy, I LOVE the one touch buttons to change speed and incline. I don't know why I didn't buy one of these for my home sooner. I got a good sweaty workout as soon as my ex boyfriend set it up for me! He set it up basically by himself but the delivery men put it where we needed it (for a fee) so we did not have to move the heavy box at all. The large cups hold my remote, my hydroflask, and my cell phone, while the lip of the console holds a book (with a book opener clip holding it open hands free).
Lastly, holding down the ifit button for 30 seconds did not work even after multiple attempts. I bit the bullet and put in my credit card. I was able to immediately cancel the membership online via ifit.com > my account > cancel benefits.
Pro Tip: watch a youtube vid on assembly, there are multiple.
I am very pleased with my purchase!
I will update if I get charged for ifit or if the machine malfunctions in anyway."
In order to bypass iFit registration, I had to put the red safety key magnet in place and THEN hold down the iFit key. I tried holding the iFit key down for 30 seconds multiple times before that with no success per other reviews, but worked like a champ in about ten seconds after putting on the magnet.
Pulse sensor wildly erratic. NordicTrack offered bogus solutions; ignored request to send someone to repair; and refused to acknowledge that the treadmill is defective. Amazon (thank you) resolved the problem.
The treadmill looks great. However, they don't tell you that once you buy it for $599.00 + tax, get it assembled ($150.00 although this was included for this deal) -- you can't just plug it in and use it!!! You have to first sign up for ifit membership (whether you want it or not) -- 30 day free trial, but you still have to provide your credit card information and remember to go cancel it after 30 days if you don't want to continue getting charged. The reason for the 1 star (there is no 0 star option), is that I still can't get it activated!!! I've signed up for the ifit membership and I got a nice email that said that the machine was unlocked and is ready to go... BUT the treadmill display still says go to ifit.com/activate -- product live customer support is only during US business hours Mon-Friday... so although delivery and assembly were completed on a Friday evening, the machine is useless until they are back on Monday... Warning for future buyers: Buy it knowing that getting to actually use it is not as easy as just plugging it in. I am very disappointing that I won't get to use it over the weekend... And depending on if the activation gets resolved on Monday, I may have to return it, which will be a hassle after getting it assembled... The person who assembled did not mention this little tibit of needing to "activate it" beyond plugging it in until he completed the assembly...
"I had concerns ordering this. Many people had bad experiences and I had one too. This thing is heavy - 200 pounds. So if the item is mishandled improperly, there is going to some damage to the plastic covers (it's very flimsy) and there is no protection on the side, Mine was broken when it came. So I called Amazon on the same day and they approved it immediately. I asked what to do about the installed one. The lady on the line said to dismantle (wrong info) and put in the box, I forgot to check the return information in my amazon account (my bad). It said that the person who will come will dismantle and take it, but I did it anyway, because of the original info from Amazon support.
The installation is pretty straightforward, but you do require one more hand and then go methodically over the instructions. The console support stands are a problem when screwing, so recommend you tilt it to the side and screw them in. The screws are tight. The unit requires 20 amp actually. My 15 amp breaks the circuit (with both units). The good and the bad:
Pros
- The unit is sturdy and looks nice. The speaker connection is nice.
- In low speeds, the unit is quiet
- The dampers allow you to run without much force on your feet
- the one touch incline is quite nice
- the heavy duty motor is good
- The 20"" wide walking belt is great
- The hydraulic support for folding the treadmill is genius.
Cons
- The Unit is very heavy. Requires two persons to assemble without risk of injury.
- Some assembly routines are hard to do
- Bolts are hard to do manually.
- Not easy to move around because of the weight. Wheels are not that helpful to move it around the room.
- Don't count on support from NordicTrac
Check the unit when it arrives. If there is damage, call Amazon and let them know. They will ship a replacement. Don't try to assemble it, because it may end up being a waste of time."
"This was my first treadmill purchase and I spent several weeks researching various models and reading product reviews to become as informed as possible. To start with, my wife and I LOVE our new Nordic Track! Is it perfect? No. Those who reserve 5 stars for only a perfect item will never rate anything 5 stars. It is a very good treadmill in my experience and while I did read of some people having technical issues, that has not been my experience. I have been regularly using my treadmill for 3 months now, so I do have a decent amount of experience with it in order to leave a fair review.
One of the things I really like about this treadmill is the iFit compatibility. There are so many different types of workouts you can select with a full range of beginner to experienced in all categories. You can choose walking, hiking, running, cross-training, walk-run, etc. and there are several series for beginners and advanced users as well. Weight loss, running series, incline series, and more. They have a great assortment of trainers and the treadmill syncs to the workout you choose and adjusts the speed and incline automatically throughout the workout. You do have the ability to easily override the auto adjustments in case you need to slow it down or want to speed it up more, but it is really nice being able to just focus on form and enjoy the workout without having to change speed and incline throughout.
I assembled the treadmill myself and it was very easy to do. Only the last part required a second person to assist and in total, it took me about 2 hours from start to finish. The instruction manual is concise and easy to follow. I was missing two small screws that secure the cup holders in place, but one call and they were quickly shipped out to me and arrived 3 days later. These missing screws did not prevent me from using my treadmill in the meantime.
I don't fold my treadmill regularly as I don't need the floor space, but I did include a picture of the folded position so you can see how it looks. If you have a lack of floor space but still want a treadmill, this may be the answer. The motor is not very loud in my opinion. It is a treadmill and there is going to be some noise. When the incline is increasing or going down, the noise is more distinct, but it really does not sound louder than one should expect to hear from a motor raising and lowering a heavy treadmill with someone on it.
The incline has a range of 0-10 and that is perfectly good for where I am at. I suppose endurance runners and very advanced users may want more of an incline, but it is ideal to me. The speed range is from 1-10 miles and I have only taken it up to 6.5mph so far. Maybe one day I will hit 10mph and wish I could go faster, but I think I am pretty good with the speed range for a long time.
I purchased the 3-year maintenance warranty on Amazon and recommend it if only to have it professionally serviced once per year. I do not want to have to deal with extra out of pocket costs if something breaks down and for $89, you can hardly go wrong. You will see when you register your treadmill on the Nordic Track site that they will offer you the same coverage, but it is a lot more expensive. Buy it through Amazon.
Finally, some people don't like the iFit membership cost. It is $15 per month or $39 per month for a family plan. I received 2 free months with my purchase and renewed it as soon as my free trial was up because it's such a great feature. If you do not want an iFit membership, you can still use the treadmill in manual mode as well as the 20 preset programs the treadmill comes with. I think it would still be a great treadmill without iFit, but I encourage you to at least use the free iFit trial period before deciding you don't want it.
The other models of this treadmill include bigger screens and higher inclines. I may upgrade myself in 3 years, but if you want a great first treadmill, I highly recommend this one."
It just arrived yesterday and I am very excited to try it out!! I paid extra for the Amazon Assembly because I didn't want to set it up wrong. I didn't any scratches or dents like others have posted it. I am giving 4 stars because I think they should have at least included a free trail for IFiT. Other than that I am happy! I will update if anything goes wrong. Great purchase! Fast shipping and great assembly!
NordicTrack honestly has some down right criminal tactics in order to make it seem like you have to buy a subscription in order to actually use the treadmill, They count on setting up a free trail you will forget about so they can continue to bill your account 15$ every month. Like they didn't just sell you an 800$ piece of equipment. The truth is you don't need a subscription, or contact them. you just have to press and hold the IFit button on your treadmill for about 30 sec, and it can be used as normal. The treadmill itself isn't bad... but nothing special either. if only i had done my research about this company i wouldn't of supported such shady tactics. The only reason i gave it one star is because no stars wasn't an option. Despite what they lead you to believe you never have to interact with this company. Don't visit their god awful website, support their criminal behavior, or give them your card's information.
"The delivery was so unreliable because Amazon handed it off to XPO and despite multiple calls and sms confirmations, they delayed the delivery and only after I complained to an Amazon rep was it scheduled and delivered on time again. The delivery guys delivered it inside the door but it's really heavy so if you want it moved somewhere you will need strong people to move it.
From an assembly point of view - it took my husband and me around 3 hours with a tool kit to assemble it. The instructions were really clear with no scope for confusion and all the parts were labeled really well. Thanks to the multiple reviews with the trick to not have to register to iFit, we were able to start the treadmill without signing up or paying anywhere. The screw and bolt for the part that helps in folding the treadmill is very weird and we were unsuccessful in getting that fixed but since we do not intend to fold it and the treadmill stays in the basement it wasn't a show stopper for us.
Performance wise it's been a few weeks since it was put to use and there are absolutely no complaints. Very easy to use, feels exactly like a regular gym treadmill."
"This treadmill broke after only two weeks of light use. We have never had a treadmill do that. Nordic Track customer is terrible. There is no human you initially talk to. Everything at initial intake is via computer only. We are on day two and have had no contact from Nordic Track. For the amount of money you spend contact should be a human not a computer!
Update cutomer service finally contacted us 1/18/20 via email only. They still aren't sending a technician out to fix it. Very dissatisfied with service on a high price item.
Second update 1/21/20. ICON fitness parent company to Nordic Trac still hasn't called or emailed regarding a service visit.
I finally called Amazon Product Support and they were great! The machine was not broken but needed to be reset. This machine needs to be plugged into a surge protected power strip. Power outage tripped the electronics up and that is why it wasn't working. The gentleman that helped me at Amazon was very good. But Nordic Trac customer service was No help at all. So for that reason I am only upgrading the review to three stars."
Treadmill did not work from the start. Had to trouble shoot with a customer support rep remotely to find out the motor did not work. So they sent a new motor and a link to a video on how to install (The video is for a different treadmill). After I did install it the belt did not fit correctly. Another 30 minute hold for tech support to tell me to adjust it according to the instruction manual. Disappointed with treadmill but more disappointed with horrible service. Wish zero stars was an option. A nice person on the phone would have been worth 3 stars.
These are discounted due to preexisting damage....They all Arrive pre broke that's why there so cheap. there where several other reviews on here with same damage I have to support this
Uh-MAZING. I paid for assembly and delivery to the exact room where my treadmill would go. After months of stalking treadmills online, scouring Offer Up, and diving deep into the Reviews sections of websites, I decided to go with this treadmill as my quarantine machine. Honestly, I wish like heck I had just taken the plunge sooner because this has been one of the BEST purchases of my year. I'm not the best runner, but I like to get a good sweat in and wanted something that offered at least up to 10mph of speed. This treadmill offers that and level 10 incline. The fold-up mechanism is also brilliant! It's so easy and there's some sort of suspension thing that make folding it up/down a breeze. I have had no problems with this treadmill and I've used it every day since owning it--usually, walk/run/sprinting anywhere from 2-4 miles. There are pulse-tracking sensors on the handles, but I don't use them because I have an iWatch. I also don't use the Bluetooth speaker stuff because I prefer to use my Alexa as it works better to annoy my Slytherin upstairs neighbors. All-in-all, I'm enamored with this treadmill and honestly wish I had gotten this thing as soon as the pandemic hit so that "quarantine fifteen" would have been in the opposite direction on the scale. This is a great piece for the casual runner and you can get your workout in any time of the day. For reference, I'm about 5'10, weigh around 185, and have a pretty long stride. The treadmill has a bit of a quake when I run, but it doesn't feel unsturdy. Final take-away: This is a good little machine. Spring for the assembly if you don't like lifting a 200-pound box and doing spatial math. You won't be disappointed!!! Can't recommend her enough! :)
"This treadmill is a great value. I paid close to double the amount for a treadmill with less features approximately 5 years ago. At home equipment keeps getting better and cheaper!
Amazon coordinated the delivery service and that was a tremendous value. I was very happy that I paid for it here. To coordinate the same service through NordicTrack's website was going to cost triple the Amazon price.
I consider myself to be pretty handy, but this still took me about an hour to assemble. Nothing terribly difficult, just time consuming!
I don't love the graphical user interface and the fact that it works over WiFi. I tend to use manual workout mode, so the extra features aren't very desirable to me. Starting a manual workout is pretty easy and quick though. It's not really a negative - I just don't care for it.
This treadmill provides a smooth, steady, and quiet ride."
"Wow! Beautiful treadmill.
It would be really nice if I could actually use it.
Be aware when you buy one of these, you will be forced to register it on-line before it will operate. Apparently you have to purchase a ""free"" 30 day trial iFit membership. Of course it's only free after you give them your credit card information and purchase a subscription for more than $100 per month, after which you can cancel. If you don't forget. And maybe they will actually cancel it before the 30 days is up. Or they may not. Who knows?
In the meantime, it takes them an hour to process your registration, before they can even help you. THEN you get to wade through their labyrinthine phone mail system to get to the right help line whereupon you get placed on hold until their phone mail system hangs up on you for no reason. Then you get to repeat the whole process several times, provided you have two to three hours to spend waiting on the hold for them to get to you. If not, come back again another day when you have more time and try it all again. This is called ""Customer Service.""
Pros: Beautiful Treadmill. Looks lovely. Has awesome reviews from people who apparently have been able to get it to work. Meanwhile it makes a great coat rack and place to store stuff. How well does it work? Personally, I haven't the foggiest. Because until I can get someone to give me some kind of access code or something I can't get past the stupid welcome screen that tells me I have to register the product. Which I've done. Several times. Several different ways. And still have no idea how to get past that stupid welcome screen.
Cons: Have I mentioned the stupid welcome screen. Why can't I just plug it in and start running?
One Star each for for appearance, speed of delivery, ease of delivery and ease of set up.
Minus two stars for difficulty registering the product, and for the sheer stupidity of forcing your customer to buy a product they don't want just to get the thing to work in the first place. (""Oh, you want a steering wheel with that car?"")"
I've had this treadmill now for over two months and have been using it fairly consistently for almost 6 weeks now. I walk and briefly run on it 4-5 days/week. I assembled it by myself, and can tell you while it is possible, it will be much easier to do it with help. For reference, I'm a 44yr old, 5'2" female. The hardest part was putting in the storage latch bar, which definitely screams for another person to hold the tread up while putting the bar in. After assembly, kept trying to bypass the iFit membership requirement but failing before realizing the emergency stop clip has to be on before you can bypass iFit. After that, started walking on it. By 3rd day, saw that the belt was shifting to the left until it was right against the side of the track. Read the instructions on how to fix this, but the fix was very short-lived. Have not been able to fix and the belt is all the way over to the left of the track. It hasnt jumped over the edge of the track though and hasnt caused any issues so I just use it while continuously monitoring the situation. Basic treadmill that does what it needs to, so fairly satisfied with my purchase for the price I paid. That could well change depending on how long it continues to work without issues. The warranty is also NOT 1 year, but a disappointing 3 months. Was not pleased to see that in the paperwork packet.
Machine is noisy. I contacted the company regarding it and another question--the reply was "we will get back to you" and that was weeks ago! The "whine" seems to be the belt or perhaps the motor (that seems to hesitate when first turned on. Also, it "squeaks" when I walk (I weigh 135, and don't use it for running.) I had another brand machine that I had used for over five years and replaced it with this one. Not a good decision. .
"I have been a fan of Nordic track for a long time... But this new nordictrack while being much more expensive than the powertrack 1500 I have been using for the longest time. Is incredible poorly made.
If your looking for a treadmill that is sturdy, simple and quick to use, enjoyable to use, quiet, or doesn't have loads of huge and sharp seams all over it this isn't your machine.
Pros:
It works with a 300lb guy, and keeps up well
Its a decent footprint, definitely a little narrow.
Folds up well... Or it would if the handles actually aligned with the frame, and didn't interfere with the folding feature... Actually that's more of a con...
Cons:
Very flimsy
Poorly made(extremely low tolerance on every part)
You will NEED to buy a proper tap and die kit to assemble this as nordictrack failed to tap several holes that the threaded bolts are to be installed into. More annoyingly the ones that they did tap where not tapped all the way through.
(to tap a hole means to put threads into such that a bolt or nut can thread or be screwed into)
You will need a (3/8"" coarse 16 tap with a long shaft)
It takes a couple of minutes from the time you turn it on and get on it before it boots up and actually let's you use it.
Its got a touchscreen... One smaller than your phone. 7"" so unless you have 20:20 vision or glasses on, theirs no using the interface at all... It also loves to pop up ads, and constantly wants your information and wifi access. No just hopping on and enjoying a workout anymore.
The fan you see in the picture, it's not real, just a fake grill, which behind it isactually a 3"" wide cage fan(sometime found in very cheap car accessories or electrical boxs) it's hyper loud, but manages to push a usable amount of air.
And that's coming from a user that has the treadmill in a server room...
Overall I'll probably have to keep it since it's a oversized thing to have shipped of picked up by Amazon, and I throughout my back getting it inside."
Don't buy this. I bought this treadmill. The first thing you see once you unpack is a big red sign, saying your treadmill is locked and you MUST visit iFit and accept their membership to get your treadmill unlocked. You must give them your credit card number and although your first month is free, then they will charge you $15.00 a month, unless YOU cancel. What a scam. I paid over $700 bucks for this treadmill, put it together and I still have to pay to get it unlocked. I could understand if they offered the iFit as extra and additional coaching helps to buy if you were interested, but to actually lock your own property and force you to give them credit card information?????
"Product page says:
""Interactive Personal Training at Home powered by iFit; 1-year iFit membership included with your treadmill; gain access to on-demand, interactive trainer-led global and studio workout programs ($396 value)""
This seems to be false. When I started the treadmill, it asked me to subscribe to iFit for 39$/month. So I contacted Amazon about my free membership, which routed me to NordicTrack. I contacted them, and they said it's not their problem, but iFit's. Finally I contact iFit. No response. I almost gave up when I stumbled upon this email address: amazon@ifit.zendesk.com - sent a request there and Monica was very nice to help me out activate my FREE membership.
This seems like a case of misleading advertising.
In any case, treadmill works fine, I'm happy with the iFit integration and the screen quality, it's just 3 stars because it was a nightmare to set up the iFit 1-year trial."
We have had our Nordic Track treadmill for about 3 months now and love it. I bought it as a way to continue walking exercise during the dark rainy winter months and assumed I might try the iFit training but would never use it. I was very wrong. The iFit has been a huge part of my success with the machine. The treadmill itself is great, the delivery was fairly easy (we had to unbox it and take it to the basement in pieces, but it worked) and assembly was okay but there was a broken piece on ours which made the assembly much harder than it should have been. We did contact Nordic Track customer service and they were very helpful and got replacement parts to us quickly. We all use the treadmill and I love the iFit training. At first I would just watch the walking tours as I walked to keep myself entertained (London, Edinburgh, Portugal, Morocco, etc) but then was enticed to start doing some interval running and walking. I am not a runner, never have been, but though using the iFit programs with trainer Tommy Rivers Puzey I am now working on a 6 week program to increase my running ability and I love it. This treadmill has been the thing that finally made me like to exercise, we love it and highly recommend it.
"We purchased this on SEP 27th and were supposed to have it delivered on OCT 4th. We also set up the in-home setup service, which I scheduled for October 5th. When 9 pm came around on OCT 4th and no sign of the treadmill, I called Amazon. The Rep was quite understanding, and after a few minutes on hold he got back on the line with me and said that our treadmill was lost in shipment. He proceeded to order us a replacement, which wouldn't arrive until OCT 16th. I rescheduled our in-home setup appointment for OCT 17th. The following Saturday I decided to call Amazon back as I was having trouble understanding how it could be lost in shipment. The Rep I spoke to was again, very courteous. She explained that she could put a tracer on the treadmill on Monday morning to try and find out more details. On Monday afternoon I received an email saying that they had found the treadmill and it was scheduled for delivery OCT 11th. I once again called in-home setup and re-scheduled my appointment to OCT 12th. On OCT 10th the in-home setup guy called and said he couldn't make it on the 12th and asked if I could reschedule my setup to the 15th of OCT. I said that wouldn't work for us and so he asked me to call him after it arrived, and he would see when he could fit me in.
The treadmill arrived today (OCT 11th), and I decided to tackle putting it together by myself. Well, me and my kitchen chair (see pictures). I tipped the delivery guy $10, and he helped me carry the (HEAVY) box to the room in my single-story home, where it was going. At a casual pace, the entire process took me an hour and a half. I used my DeWalt impact driver, a 3/16 and 7/32 hex drive bit, a Phillips bit (and screwdriver), a small adjustable wrench, and a utility knife. Putting it together wasn't terrible and the instructions are reasonably thorough. Be careful not to over tighten some of the small Phillips screws.
There were a few things I wasn't thrilled about.
1. The packaging took some shipping damage, resulting in product damage, which I detailed in the attached photos.
2. There was a random nylon locking nut laying loose in the box. I looked all over and could not find anywhere that it appeared to belong...
3. When I tipped it on edge to unwrap it from the shipping plastic, I heard small plastic pieces rattle as they slid to the other side of the motor compartment. One small plastic piece fell out, and on examination, I found that the right side of the motor hood was not as secure as it should be. There's about 1/2' to 3/4'' of play where it really shouldn't be moving. I would guess that the brackets that hold the hood in place are plastic and I assume that is the piece that you can see in my photo. It doesn't seem to have an effect on functionality, but being a new unit, I would prefer no problems.
The unit powered up and works fine so far. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to try and answer them. I'm satisfied with the treadmill overall, it seems decent. I'll be sure to update if that changes. It wouldn't hurt for Amazon to comp me $100 for shipping damage. I will add that they did comp me $90 for the extreme shipping fiasco. I also apparently have a replacement treadmill still enroute... I guess I won't sign for it..."
I'm happy with the money I spent on this for the most part. The 6.5 Si is a solid treadmill that as a taller guy I feel very comfortable running on. The maximum speeds and inclines don't match the higher-end models, but for me the 10 mph speed and 10% incline are more than enough for my uses. Assembly took a couple hours, but was fairly straightforward. I initially had some trouble activating the 1-year iFit membership, which was frustrating given that was the reason I didn't go with the 6.5 S and decided to spend the extra money on the Si. I was eventually able to get it activated after getting in contact with iFit though. The iFit programs are pretty fun and the 10" screen looks great, but the built-in speakers are not great and it was tough to find a balance that allowed me to hear both the music and the trainer clearly. Still, I do think the 1-year membership with the guided workouts add a lot of value over the 6.5 S and that's not even factoring in the 10" screen.
"We have had this unit for less than two months.
The first issue we experienced was the incline motor getting stuck in the up position. After a long wait to chat with customer service, I was asked to take a video of the issue and submit it. The whole process took about 90 minutes, and it was determined the incline motor was defective.
We received the replacement motor about 5 days later. I installed it, and it worked for about 2 weeks. It got stuck again in the up position. I tested the original motor and found that I could retract it by hand, but when I installed it, it immediately went to the up position again.
I contacted customer service again. This time it only took about 45 minutes before a CSR came online. I explained the issue, and told her I believe the computer was bad. Again, I had to submit a video. I also provided the number of my previous service ticket. It was determined that, this time, even though the symptoms were the same, it was the controller that needed replacement.
We are presently waiting for the replacement to arrive. May update at that time."
"I walked on this for the first time today and would have given it a 5-star rating, except for the following:
1) I checked the measurements in the description as best I could, and it didn't seem that there was a lot of difference between the current one that I had and this one. The console did seem larger, but there were no measurements given for it, and it is in fact, much larger than it looks in the pictures. And so I cannot get the treadmill into my bedroom (standard 29 inch door) without taking it apart. I didn't have it assembled in that room, because I was afraid I wouldn't get it back out. I would think that NordicTrack would consider that the majority of people want to hide treadmills in bedrooms and would design them to fit through those doorways. Now I have the option of having this large machine in the middle of my family room or my living room.
2) When you are looking at this on the website, they show a video of a young lady very easily moving the machine on its wheels. The fact is that it is nearly impossible to accomplish this, unless you have some serious muscle. You have to tip the machine so that it is resting only on the wheels, and in fact, the manual advises that it may take 2 people to do this. It also advises you that the unit must not be moved using any other method. So now, in addition to having a treadmill that I can't hide away in my bedroom, I can't even move it out of the way after I walk on it.
3) A little bit of minor irritation. When I got ready to walk on it for the first time, come to find out that I could not even start the machine until I signed up for the free trial of iFit, which included giving them a credit card number so that they could automatically charge me in 30 days for the program. So now I am obligated to cancel it, which I most definitely will. I should have had the option of being able to start the machine without signing up for the free trial.
Bottom line is that I like the machine, but I don't know if I am going to send it back or not. I don't want it in my living room or family room. If anyone has any suggestions on how to get it through the bedroom doorway without taking it apart, I'd like to hear them."
"Delivery: I received my Nordictrack T 6.5 S via local delivery truck the morning of Dec. 14, 2018. The delivery guys called me 30 minutes prior to arrival to give me a heads-up on their arrival time. They brought the treadmill down my driveway ramp through my basement level garage and into my basement. They removed and disposed of the giant cardboard box and all the styrofoam. What a great delivery service! I paid an additional $19.99 to have the treadmill delivered to a room I specified. This was totally worth the price.
Then came assembly. My techie roommate was able to assemble the treadmill in about 75 minutes. There was a point when I provided an extra set of hands to help with something. I can't remember what, but it was nothing major. I see that Amazon is currently offering professional assembly for no added cost. This is a pretty amazing offer that I would have been thrilled to have, especially had I not had the techie roommate that I have. At the time I purchased the treadmill, the professional assembly cost was around $100.
Performance: I am so happy with the Nordictrack T 6.5 S treadmill! I am able to walk and run to my heart's content. The belt runs smoothly and is not excessively loud. The controls are great. If I am running at 6.0 mph (I am short, so this is fast for me) and get tired, I can simply press the number 3 button on the right side of the panel, and the belt quickly slows to a speed where I can recover safely. If I want to slowly speed up or down in decimal increments, there is an up/down button on the bottom of the panel. There is also an up/down incline button to adjusts in .5 increments on the bottom left panel, or I can use the buttons on the left side of the panel to increase the grade in whole numbers. I had been looking at purchasing the Nordictrack 1750, which is more of a commercial treadmill with a much steeper price. I am so happy I did not purchase that more expensive treadmill! I do not think it would have been worth the price difference.
iFit: I am not using iFit, so I cannot comment on it. I learned how to make YouTube playlists, so I am now watching the music videos, etc., that I want to watch. It's a heck of a lot better than being subjected to whatever it is they have playing at the gym."
"I've been looking for a treadmill for quite awhile, and while I would have loved to buy one from Peloton, I didn't want to wait around until May, and I also didn't want to spend a fortune. Believe me, I thought that purchasing a treadmill under $1000 was a risky proposition, but ultimately, I am very happy with T6.5S from NordicTrack.
Let me start by saying I was skeptical about the price of $697 from Amazon. Why was it marked down so much? I think I discovered this when the treadmill was delivered to my home. Be aware that this treadmill comes in a very large box and weighs 200 pounds. I paid the extra $20 for it to be delivered to the room of my choice; which was down a flight of stairs that has some pretty tight corners. I live alone, so this was absolutely the best option. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to open the box (which had some pretty severe gouges/rips in it, by the way) until that evening. Had I been able to open it with the delivery crew present, I would have sent it back immediately. The side rail (made of mostly plastic) had ripped from the MDF underlayment (surface just under the tread), and had shattered in multiple places. I discovered this after removing several of the parts and packaging.
Well, I went right to my computer and contacted Amazon chat support to inform them of the issue. They were great, actually, and immediately scheduled the delivery of a replacement treadmill. I boxed the damaged treadmill back up, though the email from Amazon that I received a moment later told me that was unnecessary as the Amazon staff that were to pick up the damaged treadmill would bring packing materials.
So, a week later the delivery men for the new treadmill showed up. They immediately told me they wouldn't deliver the treadmill down to my basement, but after I told them that I paid for that service and argued a bit, they agreed to. I have to warn you, the design of the packaging of this treadmill is pretty poor. If it is rested on a corner of the box, or even the side with any force, it will likely get damaged. It might be a good idea to warn the delivery guys about this before they transport it to the room of your choice. I also now wonder if Amazon tried to pawn off the damaged one to me initially, knowing full well it was damaged. I guess I'll never know.
In any case, the new treadmill made it to my basement unharmed. After unpackaging all of the parts (carefully placing the foam inserts aside in case I had to repackage it), I was confident that nothing had been damaged in transport. I then read the entire assembly manual, which I highly recommend doing, so that you know what is coming. After getting the necessary tools (Screwdriver, adjustable wrench, and a socket set if you have one), I assembled the treadmill in about an hour and a half. I was able to do it myself, but it would certainly be easier with two people; particularly the point where you have to hold the treadmill up at an angle while you assemble the piston that allows you to lift it up and down for storage if you want to (I just leave mine down).
Once the entire treadmill was assembled, I plugged into the wall with a power strip (also, recommended) and turned it on. Yes, I'm sure you've read all of the other emails about the requirement to sign up for iFit. Well true, the iFit icon does show up on the screen, and there is a bunch of documentation in the packaging about it, but as everyone else has mentioned, you just hold down the iFit logo button on the keypad for about 15-20 seconds and the warning will go away. Note: you need to have the safety/Stop magnet applied to the grab bar, or this process won't work. Also, I've notice that you only need to do this the very first time you power the treadmill on; on every subsequent power-up, it goes straight to the regular dashboard.
As far as the functionality of the treadmill goes, it's actually pretty great, and just what I need. It's quite simple with settings for incline and speed (both up to 10) and I like that I can just touch '5' for 5 mph if I want to, instead of using the up or down arrows. There are some other features for different workouts that I haven't used yet, but I'm sure I will get to them. I've also discovered that it is very important to have the treadmill on a very flat surface. Otherwise, the tread will shift to one side. Even with the slightest incline in my floor, I noticed this a little bit. Once I figured out the best placement though, it was fine. Also, I noticed that the surface under the tread was virtually free of oil (probably from laying around in the Amazon warehouse for some time), so I purchased some silicone-based treadmill oil that you apply every 50 miles or so, and it works great! The display also comes with speakers installed, which guess you can plug your iPhone or iPod into with an auxiliary cord. Not sure I'll ever do that, as I just have headphones. Also, the sensitivity of the pulse meter on the grab bar has been hit or miss. Oh well, can't have everything.
So, was the process a bit of a pain? Well, yes, but overall, not too bad, and well worth it for the price. I'm totally satisfied with this treadmill and it does everything I need it to do."
"Going to be very blunt about this machine. I'm a 23 year old female who was able to put this machine (Norditrack 6.5 Treadmill) all by myself and it's honestly the best purchase ever.
Majority of these negative reviews are about how you have to sign up in order to get basically their package of running with instructors or watching the view. There's a tab on the top right where it says manual workout and you're able to get straight into your workout. I didn't need to sign up for ANYTHING OR PAY FOR THEIR MEMBERSHIP. Also, the machine came in one piece. So disregard the other bad reviews if you don't mind just running on your own with your favorite tv show playing to pass the time. 10/10 would BUY AGAIN"
I purchased this product primarily for walking when the weather doesn't cooperate (five months of snow on the ground). The treadmill itself is excellent. I did have a couple of issues that were annoying. One is the requirement to register the product and sign up for a fitness program, IFit, using a credit card. I refused to do that and was prepared to return the treadmill until I saw another review where the author explained how to by-pass the registration process by pressing the iFit button for 30 seconds. [The review from "Amazon Customer" stated, "TO GET AROUND THIS SCAM, hold down the iFit logo on the treadmill for 30 seconds and your treadmill will work. I hope this helps people from being forced to give out their credit card and personal information."] Thank you Amazon Customer! The second annoyance was an "undocumented feature" [at least I didn't see it in the manual]. The third time I used the treadmill, I put the red key on the console and I heard a motor running but the tread wasn't moving and when I pressed any of the buttons they just beeped. Nothing appeared to be happening so I removed the red key and tried several times more. Thinking that there must be some simple reason for it not working, I messaged the Nordic Track help desk describing my problem. They next day I received a reply from a nice lady who told me that the treadmill was behaving normally. It was calibrating the incline. I should put the red key on the console and let it complete the calibration process. The tread inclined all the way to the top and then all the way to the bottom. After it was finished doing its thing the treadmill worked like it should. [I'm not sure why it waited until its third use to do this. Perhaps it was because I raised the platform to the store position overnight and then set it back down the following morning. I haven't done it again, so I'm not sure that was what caused it. I call the calibration process an "undocumented feature". But, I may have just missed reading it in the manual.] Would I purchase this product again. Definately YES. It is a well build product and is easy to use, once I got past the two annoyances I mentioned above. If it weren't for them, I would have scored this product a solid five.
Just had the treadmill delivered today. It is very heavy as expected. Assembly wasn't difficult, but having two people makes it easier. Once the unit was set up and turned on the screen was stuck at activate with ifit. The machine does not need activation via ifit to work. Just hold down the ifit sync button for 15 seconds to bypass. That is not listed anywhere in the book. Once that was done, I activated the manual mode and increased the speed. The belt is making a horrible clicking noise. Searches online confirm it is a bad motor. I tried to do an amazon return but they require the unit to be disassembled and we're no help. It took forever to get through to nordictrack customer service. Make sure you register your device online before you call or you won't be able to get through. Once I did that. I was on hold for thirty minutes before I realized they had already closed. Even though the phone system let me on hold. I will try again Monday to get a replacement motor but will never buy this brand again!
"I purchased this treadmill to replace a ProForm elliptical that replaced my ProForm treadmill...because I suffer from Arthofibrosis (AF) and my knee is frozen in place. I had to pass my previous equipment to my daughter. I need to do rehab from my home, so I do not want to cheat myself on quality! I selected this NordiTrack and I am so impressed with it!
It came with a 30 day free trial of IFit An interactive workout with instructors, better than Peloton, but I have no chance of ever keeping up with them, So I do not utilize it, but I did enjoy the world tour!! I see people have made comments about it, but they obviously did not read the instructions!! ( no credit card info is required, and they send an email at the end of the 30 days if you want to purchase it monthly)
I photographed the ledge where I store my IPad, because it is wide enough, I do not have to remove the keyboard! BONUS! And the ˜cup holder' is way larger than others. Feel free to place your 1/2 gallon water bottle ðŸ˜‰. (Someone really thought this out). Look at the large operation area! It looks like it belongs in a Commercial gym, yet it fits perfectly in my small gym, which is the size of my smallest bedroom. I can not go outside to walk, so this is a life saver for me. I treated myself without emptying my bank account. The shock absorbers under the platform are easy on my sore legs and the rails are long enough that I do not have to purchase separate medical safety rails! (They did not miss a thing on this model). The more expensive models are great too, with huge screens, but with the space for the iPad, I can still enjoy the large screen without the large price! My therapy room is complete and I am on my way to a healthier body!"
"So for a 2.6HP treadmill with this belt size, the price was right.
Delivery: I opted to pay $20 extra for 'in room of choice' delivery. Without a helper this thing would have been impossible for me to bring in the house. It is quite large box (7ft long? 2.5ft wide?) and quite heavy (200lbs?) So $20 well spent. Two people came and delivered it. They scheduled with me 48 hours in advance, it was a 4 hour window of delivery. I just needed to be home and point where I wanted them to leave the box.
Assembly: I see a lot of complaints about assembly. I would say it is about as difficult as similar fitness equipment. You will need a few hand tools: screw driver (phillips), 14mm wrench (an SAE size also seemed to fit, but 14mm fit better), it comes with an allen/hex key. An electronic screwdriver or drill with hex key bit and phillips bit will make things easier - but be very careful not to overtighten small screws that go through plastic fittings. Assembly likely took me about 2 hours? A helper will make things much easier - though I did it by myself I wouldn't recommend it - there were a couple of times the book said get a helper and I didn't and it occurred to me that if I slipped or lost grip it was going to hurt really badly if something came crashing down that I was holding in place while I used my other hand to turn a screw or bolt. Basically I'll say this - if you don't think you could assemble a kid's bicycle, then pay for someone else to assemble it. If you don't have screwdrivers or wrenches, pay for someone else to assemble it. If you don't have a helper, pay for someone else to assemble it. I'm really lucky I didn't slip and hit my head or crush my hand when I was too impatient to wait for a helper to come home from work :)
Functionality - as has been reported in other reviews, you turn it on and it says it won't do anything until you activate it only. Activation basically signs you up for an account. I didn't bother. I'm never going to use the ifit function and I don't want to give my info to one more company that doesn't need it.
If you turn power on, then hold down ifit button for 30 seconds - it will skip the activation process. I read this from another reviewer, and it worked.
Other than that - features are as described. It's a treadmill. It's not any more quiet or loud than any other residential treadmill I've seen. I'm sure that in a year I'll need to adjust the belt, and lubricate it. That's pretty typical."
Took less time to assemble than it did to unpackage! Easy lift and lowers with an automatic shock. I read previous comments and learned you can skip the ifit registration by simply holding down the ifit (blue) button for about 30 seconds- then you don't have to pay to subscribe and it works like a regular treadmill. I'd suggest to watch for a good price bcz they seem to list the same product with different prices occasionally. The week before I ordered it was 599, when I ordered it was 679. So far I love it and it's not holding any clothing yet!
This is a heavy-duty machine. You can not set this up by yourself; it definitely needs two people. The speakers are decent. Since this is for home use they are loud enough. If you want something a little louder then you have to connect another speaker with the aux cable in order to amplify the sound. I have used this machine every day for over an hour. It runs quietly. My only complaint is that it makes a popping noise when you first increase your incline. I am going to ask Norditrac about that sound. It folds at an angle so it still takes up space. The machine is heavy so use two hands to lift it when folding. When opening it, the machine will take over halfway and descend slowly so you don't have to bend or fear dropping it. I walk, jog, run and climb on this machine and I feel great afterwards
I've owned this machine for 6 months and could not be more pleased with it. It performs flawlessly and does everything you could ask of a treadmill. I especially love the smooth automatic incline that gives me the "hill" resistance I need to train. I'm 5' 10" and 180 lbs, and the sturdiness and deck length are perfect for me. I would guess the machine would be well suited for anyone up to 200 lbs and 5' 11" but beyond that a larger heavier machine might be needed. Folds up easily for storage between workouts. Assembly requires two people, or if you've assembled treadmills before (as I have) you can manage it alone. As to VALUE....it's worth way more than the asking price! Get it.
Please listen closely to this review. I just recently purchased this treadmill. All the reviews you read about how difficult it is to put together is not accurate. If you are just the least bit handy you can set it up no problem. It took me about an hour and a half to get it setup and running once I got it out of the box. The only reviews that are accurate are the ones that mention the IFIt subscription. They state you must login to activate the machine then you are asked to pay $15 a month. This is true however all you need to do once the treadmill is setup is turn it on and hold down the ifit button for 20 to 30 seconds and it will immediately activate. Shame on Nordic track for that however from scam perspective I bet they have a great legal team that could argue to that point. Now to speak to the treadmill itself it works perfect, very sturdy can't even hear the belt or motor while using.
"I just want to start by saying I had researched treadmills for quite a few months before purchasing this. The price was great. Not too fancy but not too basic. That's pretty much where it ends.
Upon arrival, the metal frame in the front of the treadmill at the base showed up damaged. I tried calling. I tried chatting. I tried emailing. Getting the run around over and over and over again! They wont even acknowledge the fact that it's damaged. I am beyond frustrated with their customer service.
The free year of iFit set up was not in my package, that I can see. I tried contacting them about that an assured me it is and to look again. (I dont see it here)
The treadmill has been powered on in the past months to set up my account. I went to further look at the iFit stuff on the actual treadmill to see what's free and what isn't. It wasnt loading anything so I turned the whole thing off. Now it wont turn on at all! (I do not have it in a GFI outlet and yes the outlet works, nothing has been tripped.)
So not only do I have a damaged treadmill that they refuse to talk to me about, and a free year of ifit that doesnt seem to exist. The thing now just doesnt work.
So I guess, buy at your own risk."
This treadmill performs well. For my purposes, it is perfect. The uphill function isn't that great, but it will give a slight incline. The machine is rather loud, so I have to use headphones when I want to watch or listen to anything. Moving it around is a little challenging but I like that it is foldable so it doesn't take up too much room. I took a star off because the machine was cracked during delivery and they try to trick you into buying a membership to use the machine. There is a very small selection that allows you to bypass the membership to start the machine.
"This looks like it could be a nice treadmill, especially if you enjoy the iFit app and video workouts. Unfortunately, my machine arrived defective out of the box. Despite being properly grounded, it shocked me any time touched. Not a humidity issue. Not a sneaker issue. Just a faulty machine. Unfortunately, it looks like faulty machines are common with NordicTrack (perhaps that is why they have discontinued this model...think about that before buying it). Even worse, customer service is non-existent. Extended warranty...doesn't matter.
Service is slow and difficult to work with. In my case, they decided to send a new cable, despite explaining to them that I had checked the grounding. So, I had to wait two weeks for a cable to arrive, knowing it wouldn't work. Not surprisingly, the issue wasn't resolved, so I called them to have a technician come. Apparently, they forgot to arrange a technician. I called two weeks later for an update and was promised a call within 24 hours. 5 days later, still nothing. I finally received a technician's call 4 weeks later. When they arrived, it was clear they wouldn't be helpful....they said they were only there to reattach the cable (and not actually diagnose the problem). They ripped the mat under my treadmill. And they not only left three screws out of their holes, but also left a loose screw in the motor box! I realized it because every time I lifted the treadmill up and down, I could hear it fall. So I opened up the motor box and there it was....lucky it didn't blow out the motor.
Despite explaining all of this to customer service weeks ago, I haven't even received the courtesy of a response or a simple apology (never mind getting someone here to fix the original issue). I'll be returning the treadmill and look forward to the new Sole F80 I just ordered."
"This treadmill is absolutely amazing!! Fits perfectly and nicely in my bedroom! I was able to assemble it in about two hours. Two people would def help but honestly nothing a secure chair and a little manipulation can't help. You will need help to get the base where you want it, but once in place you can put it together solo ðŸ‘ðŸ»
Sound: very quiet for a treadmill. I am able to workout at night and share a wall with other tenants and no complaints or issues. Some people say it squeaks, it should not, mine does not at all.
Run: this thing works like a charm. I've only had this a week and logged over 25 miles and been able to use this machine twice a day some days without any problem.
Con: the factory defect that those speak of on here is true. The controls are missing buttons, but honestly for the price I'm not completely worried about it.
ifit: you don't have to register for it before starting machine, just turn on and hold ifit for 30secs to bypass and you're all good. Also you can still sign up and use your 1 year ifit after you have done this."
The assembly was a little more than expected on this machine, but doable. I downloaded the ifit app and did some of the workouts which i enjoyed, but not enough to pay monthly. I decided to just jump on and do a manual workout without the app and quickly realized there is no way to pause the machine if you are interumpted during your workout (kids, bathroom break, etc) I contacted the company and they said unless you pay for the monthly membership there is not a pause option...so I have to pay to pause my workout which is a basic feature on treadmills....and this one is supposed to be smart...well I don't agree!! I would not recommend this product unless you plan to pay for the membership, and even still you have to connect to the app to have the pause option...still rediculous
"This review is more of a warning for buyers in early 2020. Apparently there was a manufacturing issue with this model and an entire row of buttons is missing. I had this with 2 of them, so I would assume all that were produced around the same time have this problem.
Amazon was great and sent the replacement and then ultimately picked them both up.
First photo is what I received, 2nd is what it should have. There was no way to set a workout without these buttons.
If you rubbed your fingers across the area you can feel where the buttons should be, but they did not function."
"You can bypass ifit and activate the treadmill by holding down the ifit button for about 30 seconds.
It is such a scam to imply that a membership for ifit is required to activate the treadmill. I started to register for ifit, then stopped immediately when it asked for my credit card info. We were able to successfully activate by holding down the button."
Without my gym and pilates studio during this pandemic I have gained quite a few pounds. This treadmill was the best purchase I could have made to help shed those extra pounds. As you can see from the picture, I mounted a little television and fan on the wall in front of the treadmill. I love to come home from work and immediately put on my workout clothes and spend an hour on my treadmill running or doing hills. I just zone out to something on Netflix, and if it's a really good show, I'll stay on for 90 minutes or more. I love that you can adjust the shock absorption, great for my joints when I'm running. The only downside is you can't program your information into the treadmill itself, you have to subscribe to iFit at $15 a month. I am taking advantage of the one free month, but the only feature I use is putting in my own workout, I don't care to use the workouts they offer, they really aren't that great.
"It's been nine years since I went for a run. That length of time shocked me. I used to run a couple times a week. I kept giving myself the excuse of not running because it was always too hot or too cold outside. I never went to the gym because it cost too much and the added 20-30 min. roundtrip each day adds up.
I gave in and in a moment of mania bought the best treadmill I could afford. Paying $20-$30 for me and my spouse to use a gym to run, means that this treadmill will pay itself off in 2-3 years. We've been using it for two months now. It gets daily use.
I've managed to eliminate the excuse of too hot or too cold by having a home treadmill. I've eliminated the excuse of not going to the gym because it's too far and is too much added time. I've had my cardiovascular health improve by leaps and bounds over the last to months by just jogging for 30 mins. or by running intervals for 20-30 mins.
It's a habit that needs to be developed. It's a commitment that needs perseverance. But it's a commitment and habit that is worth it beyond measure, especially for someone like me that works mostly behind a desk at a mostly sedentary job.
The treadmill has two cushions on either side. The cushions reduce the impact and wear and tear on your joints. The controls are easy to use. You can pay an additional $15/month to use iFit, and must create an account in order to first set up your treadmill (which is stupid). The app is cool and pairs nicely with a treadmill especially using the iPad. In the end, not needing or wanting the app, it's just annoying that you have to set up an account to use the treadmill.
I'm 5'11"" and have a decently long stride. My wife is 5'9"" and fits perfectly on the tread. I, however, could have used the additional 5"", but paying another $300 for a 60"" tread length was out of my budget. I don't use the Aux in jack or the built in speakers. They sound much worse than a decent pair of headphones and it's a bummer that the BT connection doesn't work with music.
The heart rate monitor is incredibly inaccurate, but a fitbit or apple watch is just what you need. There's a big discrepancy between the mileage of the treadmill and my apple watch (which is more accurate).
Overall it serves a purpose, namely allowing me to run in my home. I use it for that. I use the incline. I use the speed controls. I don't use all the other features. The cushions are wonderful it would be great to have both more cushioning and a longer tread length, but in the end, all the added cost and unused features weren't worth it for me. This was a worthwhile investment for me and I'm glad to have made the lifestyle change. I can't wait to see where I am in a year."
"The Mrs. and I were wanting ""just a treadmill"". We didn't want, nor need the wifi enabled, networked, ifit instructors on the screen yelling at you to run faster, 1080p 64"" TV screen so you can watch your movies while running ""running experience"" . . . . we just wanted a solid treadmill that we can get on for 20 minutes a day and get a workout on. And this is the PERFECT machine for what we were looking for.
It's solid, so don't expect a 1 person lift . . . . this thing is heavy, and you'll need a dolley to move it around to where you want it in the house. It's also not super easy to assemble. It took my teenage son and I about 2 hours to get it all unpacked, assembled, and remove all the packing boxes and material. There are several pieces that you really should assemble with 2 people . . . one person holding the part/s and the other one screwing bolts together. Now, that being said, the assembly was not complicated, and the instructions were easy to understand and follow. I would just strongly recommend that you move it around and assemble with 2 people.
And so far, this machine is working awesome, and is used just about every day. It's also very intuitive to get it going.
1) turn on the power
2) step on the treadmill
3) push the big green ""start"" button
4) push the big ""+"" or ""-"" buttons until you get it to the speed you like
5) push the big ""<"" or "">"" buttons to incline to the ramp to the slope you want
6) enjoy until you want to stop, and then you just hit the big red ""stop"" button.
That's it . . . too easy.
Now, it does have programmable settings, and a heart rate monitor, etc. etc. etc. . . . but we've not even looked at those. The Mrs. gets on and puts the speed to 3.5 at slope 1, and goes for 12-15 minutes. I get on and put the speed at 5.0 at slope 1.5 and go 20 minutes; and we're both happy.
Would highly recommend this product.
OH, and FYI . . . if you want to turn it on without having to register with IFIT online . . . just hold the little blue ifit button that's just below the LED screen for 30 seconds . . . and you can bypass all the online registration for ifit. That's one we had to figure out the hard way. We had to register online for an ifit subscription for them to tell us that all we have to do it hold the button for 30 seconds to not have to register. of course, they tell you that after you register."
"So far so good, machine has been in house for a week of steady use between my wife and myself,
I did not pay for the ""free"" installation service, and although it would have saved time, i was able to put it together myself.
PRO TIP: one of the last steps is to put the adjustment bar underneath the frame so that you can lock the machine up in place when not in use, do this BEFORE you put on the legs when you can flip the base on its side, this was a pain in the rear attempting to one arm hold the machine up and then unscrew and place that pole in place.
I hope this helps! -Mr.J"
"At the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, I decided to purchase the NordicTrack. We comparison shopped and selected NordicTrack based on price, features and company reputation. We anticipated our local athletic facility would close and did not want our cardio health to suffer.
Given the ongoing pandemic crisis, I am so glad this was purchased!
OBSERVATIONS
It is width is greater than a standard doorway! You'll need to assemble where you want to use it. OR have an extra wide doorway. I moved mine and had to remove the monitor.
Place 1 inch padding underneath unless you place it on concrete.
Reasonably easy to move... 2 wheels on base
It is heavy and requires 1 person to relocate (200lbs+)... if moving in narrow spaces.... 2 people.
Power cord is not long enough. A nice extension cord works or circuit protected outlet strip would work nicely.
Installation is fairly easy, just follow the directions - no freelancing.
Packaged nicely and parts are marked.
This model has a small screen with character graphics.... really Nordic this is 2020. 10in ""real"" screen drives price to $1k and for me that defeats the purpose of a backup while we wait for Covid-19 to pass.
Be careful the tread bed seems shorter than a commercial model... so beware and adjust accordingly.
It's Made in China! However fit, form and function is good. Again nicely packaged. We'll see how long this lasts.
So far we are very happy with it.
PROS
Price - Overall performance
Feel of the belt
General features are great (Note: this is not a commercial product)
It feels substantial not inexpensive
In closing, this product fits our needs - nicely and at a reasonable price.
Recommend it for home use."
"For the cost, I expected far more advanced technology'. Seems like this might've been made in the early 90s?.. Just an aux connection?
Not a pile of dodo by any means though, it's actually easy to assemble and somewhat durable.
BUT - the cost is far too high because you WILL NEVER get your ROI here. Joining a gym would be a better idea.
Important to note - this treadmill comes with a few documents asking you to activate the treadmill by going to some IFIT website. IN MY OPINION thats borderline ˜false advertising˜ because it could not be further from the truth. Simply hold the iFit blue button for 30 seconds and you bypass it, no problem."
"Ok, so, I've had this treadmill for 8 months now and I feel like I can give it a thorough and fair review. Let me preface this review by saying this treadmill gets used 3-4 times per week, used by in shape and not overweight people and used typically below its speed and incline maximums. For comparison, my previous treadmill was one that purchased from Sears and used in the same manner for almost 20 years with NO issues at all. Now for the reasons for my 1-star rating. After only 3 months of use, the treadmill stopped working, the belt would not start. I contacted NordicTrack customer service and it was determined that the control module was bad. They sent a new control module for me to replace, but I was left with no treadmill for 3 weeks while waiting for the part. Fast forward to just 2 days ago. While running at a moderate pace at an incline of 1%, I heard a loud crack and realized the entire board that the belt runs around was cracked lengthwise right down the middle for the entire length of the board. I am about 190lbs and this treadmill is rated for 300lbs, so please know weight was not the issue. I reached out to NordicTrack customer service today and now I'm waiting for board to be shipped to me, which is currently out of stock. This will have me down for at least another 3 weeks. I purchased this treadmill based on the rating and, what I thought to be, a reputable brand. I couldn't have been any more mistaken. If you're going to drop some money on a treadmill, don't choose this one. If you need to, spend some extra $ and get a treadmill with actual reliability. If your treadmill is going to become a clothes rack, then go ahead and get this tread, as it will function quite well and reliably for that function.
I need to add a short bit about assembly of this treadmill. I am very mechanically inclined, I do most of my own home repairs and I assemble everything I purchase. This treadmill was poorly constructed and some of the parts did not fit and align properly, which made the assembly difficult and frustrating. Some parts of the assembly instructions were vague as well.
One last thing, once fully assembled, you will not move this through interior doorways without removing the door from its hinges. Even after removing the door, it's a tight squeeze that I wouldn't recommend. Most likely it will require some minor disassembly in order to move through a doorway with ease.
I hope this review helps you in making your purchase decision."
"I wish I could comment more on the treadmill itself, but instead I am still dealing with the nightmare that has been getting it. This is the first time I've gone so far as to write a negative review, I am not usually a ""Karen"" about things, but it has been that awful. Amazon gives no other recourse for such feedback that I was able to find, so here we are.
Chapter One - Monday: The original treadmill showed up from Priority Express looking like it came through a wood chipper, so I wasn't surprised to find it broken once unpackaged. The return process sounded easy enough; a new one could get here quickly, but it would take two weeks for the broken to get retrieved. I do not have room for two, so I waited the two weeks to have a pick-up/drop-off scheduled on the same day. They were kind enough to offer an unsolicited $20 credit for the inconvenience, which I thought was nice, since nothing too bad had happened yet.
Chapter Two - Monday: The new one arrives as promised via Priority Express, but they ""have no paperwork"" for picking up the old. I'm informed it must be a different third party doing that piece later in the day. By 4pm I am calling Amazon and asking for an update, and I'm told they're not sure what happened with the return piece, but the soonest they could have it retrieved would be four days following. Fine. I ask for a confirmation email this time, since this was my second attempt. I received an email from Pilot with a scheduled pick-up time/date and confirmation number. Great.
Chapter Three - Thursday: No one from Pilot shows up, though my tracking # says someone is out to pick it up as of noon. I call their number and I'm told no one was in my area today, and the soonest they can come is the following Monday. I inform them this is the second time I've had to arrange my schedule around this pick-up that keeps not happening, so is there a way to confirm this will happen. Internally, I'm lamenting this stupid treadmill is still taking up a ridiculous amount of space in my small house. Amazon doesn't even show that I'm still owing them this return, it's clearly been lost in the ether at this point, but I still don't feel right not getting it back to them somehow. I'm told by the gentleman that if I leave it outside with a note, then I don't need to be home. Awesome.
Chapter Four “ Present Day: It's now 3pm and I'm about to cry. So, I call Pilot again. After 15 minutes on hold, I'm told it is scheduled for pick-up today and they will call me. I confirm it's still OK I'm not home for the pick-up, as the treadmill is now sitting in front of the house with a note. I'm told no, someone needs to sign for it. I explain the last person told me that was not the case and could they please be informed of their misunderstanding so other customers are not being confused. To this, I'm told there is no record of me speaking to anyone before, so they don't know where I got that information. But I need to sign for it. I'm now speechless and beginning to question my sanity.
Epilogue: Amazon, I really am trying to get this monstrosity of exercise equipment back to you. But at this point, if the thing isn't off my front lawn by the time I finish work tonight I will likely go Office Space on it.
Acknowledgements: If you made it this far, thank you for reading my tale of Amazon woe. To my husband, thank you for your unwavering support during this trying experience. And finally, to my brother-in-law, thank you for helping us get the stupid beast of a thing outside. We literally couldn't have done it without you."
"I ordered this machine to try to do something (beside eating) during quarantine.
My husband put it together in a couple of hours. The only time he needed my help was to assemble the parts that goes under the machine that makes it able to fold.
Once ready it is pretty sturdy. Obviously not as the ones at the gym, but mostly because it is smaller. The bed is shorter than the pro, but that's exactly why it is perfect for a house, in my case for my garage. It is somewhat light weight. You can move it a little.
As soon as you press start it ask you to connect it with IFIT. I did not do that. I pressed the iFit button for 30 seconds and it was override. You CAN use it without the app. BUT, I bought the 5'' screen. I can't watch anything more than my stats there. Maybe if you buy the machines with larger screens the iFit app could be a good idea. It depends on your likes. But you can totally use this model without the app (6.5s)
The machine is very smooth. No weird sound beside the normal sound of the belt running.
This machine does not have a fan (I don't need it) , and has good speakers.
I do mostly sprints, so I move from power walking with encline for 1 minute to all out for 1 minute for 15-20 min, and the machine works perfectly in those speeds and incline changes. It does change the speed fast. So you need to be attentive.
My 5'' screen shows me cal, distance, time, laps...
The folding process is super easy! And like I said before it is not super heavy, and when going down to the floor is smooth, soft and slow. It does not fall fast.
It has a space where you can put your phone or tablet on the front. 2 cup (or towels or whatever) holders on the sides. And the STOP button with the strap for emergency.
Since we put it together I've been using it everyday. And I really like it. I could definitely recommended it."
"I purchased this treadmill because I wanted to exercise indoors. The hardware itself seems sturdy and it only took me about 30 mins to put everything together. That's when I discovered that you cannot actually use the machine unless you ""activate"" it with ifit.com. This involves you setting up an account, downloading their app, and giving your personal information and credit card info. Then the app pairs with the treadmill and you can use it. I find this to be deceptive. Had this ""requirement"" been clearly stated on the marketing info, I'd have purchased another product. After the treadmill was activated, I promptly cancelled my ""subscription"" that I didn't want in the first place. It's too bad because the actual hardware seems pretty nice and I've enjoyed using it so far.
Edit: I noticed after the purchase that it's possible (though not documented in the materials shipped with the unit) that it is possible to activate the treadmill without forking over your credit card info and personal data. Pity I only saw that after the fact. It's the review with the most helpful ""likes"". Read that before purchasing."
Warning, treadmill box delivered is 200lbs. Couldn't lift it myself, had to slide the box into the house, but box wouldn't fit through the door. Took treadmill out and slid it on a rug into the room. Assembly instructions were really straightforward. Took me a couple hours. Also, the threads on the 1 silver ground screw were defective, so it wouldn't screw in. This screw is important because it grounds the machine to prevent electric shock. Replacement screw is .99 cents plus shipping. Amazon support credited me for the replacement screw. Will update this review again once I receive the replacement screw. Edit- never received the replacement screw. Bought one from local hardware store.
Runs great when it runs. About every two uses, it blows the power out in the room. We called Nordic Track and were told since our circuit breaker was large enough to accommodate the equipment, we need an "arc filter". After my husband gave the a piece of his mind for not listing that anywhere or including it with the treadmill, they sent us one. The treadmill ran for two days with no power issues but has now blown the power again. Very frustrating to spend this amount of money on something that has caused so much trouble.
"First, the speed calibration is way off. I set it for 6.0 MPH (10:00 miles) and timed the belt, it was running 6.6 MPH (9:06). If you're a runner at all, you know that's a HUGE difference.
Also, the iFit app is terrible:
- The app takes over your phone's screen for your entire workout. I use my phone to play music when I work out. Want to skip a song? Nope, can't do that, the iFit app has taken over the screen. Read the text I just got to see if it's an important work text? Nope, can't do that. So not only does it require your phone in order to work out, but it turns your phone into a useless brick for the duration of the workout.
- When I start the treadmill it gives me a 3 minute warmup before the ""workout"" starts. But I warm up before I get on the treadmill, always have. Nope, can't do that, you're gonna do our warmup. Which would be fine, I'd ignore the warmup and just set the speed to my workout pace, except that it resets the time and distance indications at the end of the 3 minute ""warmup"".
- This would be terrible enough if the whole app wasn't a blatant attempt to get me to pay $15/month for the privilege of using the treadmill I just paid $700 for. I did read the fine print that the credit card number was optional, so I didn't enter it. Does that mean my treadmill will stop working when the 30-day ""free trial"" is over? Since Amazon's return policy is also 30 days, I don't intend to keep it long enough to find out.
Based on comments in the reviews, i tried holding the ""IFit sync"" button down for 30 seconds to bypass the app. Yeah, that worked. As long as you don't let the treadmill sit for a few minutes -- it then resets back to needing the app, and pushing the button doesn't work any more, you need to switch the treadmill off and back on again and then hold the button down for 30 seconds.
I regret buying this treadmill. It might just be usable: I could adjust my speed setting based on measuring the belt speed, and I could hit the sync button for 30 seconds every time I want to use it... but that would require me to trust that the thing will continue to work once the 30 day free trial / Amazon return window has expired. Let me get this straight: you want me to bet $700 that that this thing won't hold me for $15/month ransom when the whole experience has already been skeezy as heck? Yeah, sure, I totally trust you guys.
Plus, frankly, I'm pissed off. I paid twice as much for this treadmill as the $350 entry level model I had previously, and what I got was badly calibrated equipment, a terrible app, and a blatant grab for more of my cash. At least the entry level model was honest about what it was."
"Once upon a time, I was an All-American track athlete. But alas, age, life and children have caught up with me. Enter my new mechanized running apparatus. I bought it for the sole purpose of losing weight; it's working.
The rundown.
It's a treadmill, and does what a treadmill is designed to do; relentlessly circulate a belt at variable speeds helping the user lose weight and get in shape.
Look, it's not hard to put together if you or someone you know has any inkling of mechanical knowledge, and if you can read and follow basic directions for assembly, then you're golden. If not, pay someone who is to do it for you. I'd wager It'll take most people 1-2 hours to assemble; make sure you have help, it's a two person job.
The iFit is a joke for the price. Bypass this feature by installing the red, magnetic kill switch thingy...then simply hold down the blue iFit logo for 15-30 seconds. Boom, done. You can now use your treadmill without paying a king's ransom for a gimmick that is in all honesty, not worth the price.
This is perfect for what I need it for. 45 minutes a day, 5 days a week. And a great coat rack in between."
"Overall, I am really happy with this purchase. I waited to write the review until I had enough time using it..
First, the bad-- it was NOT easy to put together. It took me and my daughter about 5 hours and countless expletives to assemble. I almost have up at least twice, and I still can't bring myself to finish installing the fold up bar thing. (We just leave it open because we don't need the space, but TBH it doesn't look like it would help much to fold it anyway). I'm not an expert at anything mechanical, but I have never encountered a piece of furniture or household repair that has been as frustrating and difficult as this. If I had to do over, I would've paid extra for assembly.
Now the good--this is a very high quality treadmill. It's not something you would see at the gym, but I am really impressed by how well made and sturdy it is. It also has a lot of shock absorbtion, which was one of the things I really looked for. I have trouble with knees/hips from years of (over)training. The combo of this treadmill and my Hoka Bondis or Saucony Endorphin shifts is perfect--no pain.
Another plus-- i was wary of the iFit thing after reading some reviews that said it was a rip-off and basically ruins the utility of the treadmill if you don't pay. However, the account is free and you don't have to give them any credit card info to automatically charge when the trial runs out. I might actually pay for it, which as a serious cheapskate, I never thought I'd do. I have really enjoyed the workouts. You watch a video with a trainer running in awesome, exotic locations and the treadmill automatically adjusts incline and speed to match what you see. As someone who needs to be pushed (I lack the ability to voluntarily move out of ""light exertion""), my workouts are waaaay more challenging and productive when I'm following an iFit trainer. I haven't actually tried using the treadmill without it, but my daughter runs intervals on ""manual"" all the time with no issue. She says it's like a regular treadmill that way.
Bottom line--if you have already spent a ridiculous amount of time researching every possible option (it took me 3 months to decide), you know that this one pops up on most of the ""best"" lists. Rightfully so. If you can get it for under $1k, go for it."
"This is my best purchase since covid . Totally worth the money
However to be honest the shipping was quite a hassle . I have heard similar issues with everyone that has ordered this item.
The final mile delivery in may city is done through one provider , and all of my friends have faced the same issue with their treadmill delivery - they don't communicate and are NOT on time .
I had taken a day off to accept the delivery and assemble it , however the treadmill Did NOT arrive. I had to go through many amazon customer service calls to finally get a status of my shipment , and it didn't arrive till a week later .
Once it arrived it was a task to fit it inside my home . The box is 300lbs and the delivery is doorstep only. NO IN-HOME DELIVERY.
Once unpacked I noticed the treadmill shipment was damaged - delaying my installation process . The damaged parts were replaced free of cost but they took 4 weeks to arrive . So overall I was only able to use my treadmill 6 weeks After I got it ! It was just lying around occupying space for that long !!!
The treadmill does require two to assemble, and while the assembly can take time its not impossible for novice handymen.
You do need to follow the steps precisely and I had to watch the YouTube video numerous times to capture the details
But once assembled the product is great .
The screen is great and the user experience is seamless too.
I skipped signing up for the IFIT membership but I will do so at some point to utilize my free year .
The one thing I do want - is video streaming on the screen. You'd think that a 14 inch screen would allow streaming Netflix, but it does not . I hope this is something they introduce with a firmware update in future .
In the meantime I use the google maps feature a lot.
I would recommend the product, but please be aware of the hassle that comes with shipping and installation ! I wish a company like AMAZON would have the best supply chain / shipment network .
But clearly this is not the case with their NordicTrack shipments"
"Treadmill arrived damaged. It's bad enough that you have to set it up yourself following their very poorly written instructions but then it arrives broken.
Will update when I've finished putting it together, but if you are planning to buy one, just know they will not install it for you due to Covid and the machine itself weighs about 200lbs so be very sure when you tell the delivery guys where to put it.
Update: the spot that was cracked when the product arrived completely broke in half after first use. And by first use, I mean walking slowly for two minutes or less. After this first use, it also became obvious that the belt is over an inch off center. So we will have to fix that ourselves as well, no doubt. Will update again regarding my experience with customer service."
"I just finished my first running workout on it. So far so good. I ran 3 miles on it, at up to 5.6 mph. As far as assembly, the instructions are good, and the parts are well marked. It isn't too hard to assemble, but small manufacturing faults make it harder than it should be. I had one hole that wasn't completely threaded. By repeatedly tightening and loosening an extra screw I was able to make it work. Several threaded holes were painted over, making hand tightening a bit difficult. Annoying, but not a deal breaker. The 800 number wants you to register the product to talk to someone. I didn't bother and figured it out myself. In spite of their crafty wording, as others have said you DO NOT have to register with iFit if all you want to do is manual workouts. Simply press and hold the iFit button when you power up.
I have had 4 months. I use it for running when it's too cold or raining outside. So far.... no problems."
"Ok it is fine. Skip the sub junk and hold the button down for apx. 30 seconds.
WHOEVER the cross eyed s.o.b that was in charge of pre drilling holes the day mine was made needs to be fired. I fought this thing like it owed me money."
"Two stars due to setup instructions that pressure you to provide credit card information to use the treadmill.
To expand on this, once you set up the treadmill, there is a sticker that reads ""Your smart treadmill is currently locked. It will not start until you go ifit.com/activate."" When you visit that site, it will ask you to enable cookies. When you decline, it breaks cookies into four categories, one of which is ""essential"". Once you make it through to the site, it looks like a marketing landing page! To create an account, they try and get you to enter your full name and credit card information. The model we purchased does not even have an HD screen, so we do not want an iFit account and certainly do not want to share our personal information.
To bypass this, do two things. First, make sure that the red emergency key is engaged on the treadmill. Second, hold down the iFit button for 15-30 seconds. This will allow the treadmill to function.
In short, the printed instructions regarding iFit are simply false. This is terrible customer service and a potential legal liability for NordicTrack. I hope that they will value customer experience over subscription revenues in the future."
"Given that it is a very sturdy product, it's no surprise that the shipping box is
VERY heavy. If you aren't comfortable moving 200 pounds of box from your front door, you might want to arrange for a delivery option that includes putting the box where you want it inside your house. Also, unless you really enjoy DIY with lots of parts, you might want to also chose an option that includes setup. In our area, which is off the beaten path, Nordic Track contracts with ICON for setup. I cannot say enough nice things about the tech which set ours up. Watching him made me very thankful that we opted for professional help. After 3 weeks we really are enjoying the treadmill. It is very sturdy and has a lot of features that make working out safe, easy and enjoyable."
"The treadmill arrived and the two delivery people placed the box in my living room. Great service. It took about three hours to remove the treadmill from the box and assemble. Then in a very large red STOP sign image the treadmill is locked and you must join iFIT to unlock. Well I don't want to join iFIT I just want a treadmill. After further research other posters on Amazon stated the workaround is to hold down the iFIT button for about 15 seconds. So now the treadmill works without joining iFIT. Now it is time to register and again their marketing arm gets into the act trying to sell upgraded warranty. Awful ....
By the way the treadmill works as advertised although rather large for my house. Word of warning be sure to assemble the treadmill in the room that it will reside as it is 35 inches wide at the console and won't fit through my doors without disassembly."
"This review is for the T 9.5s. I did not buy it off Amazon. I am trying to write this review solely on the treadmill and not the ifit. Since I've had the free trial of ifit since day one, not sure if some things will be different for those who skip.
I've had this treadmill for 3 months now and have used it daily, sometimes even more than once a day. I have the free ifit and love it. That being said, I'm not sure how much I would love it without ifit, I'm not sure if it impacts some of the features, like, it takes a good minute or so to start up. I could see how this could be annoying. I go fill up my water and put on my running shoes etc. By the time I am done it's usually loaded up.
All the workouts, even manual, start up with a 3 min warmup. This is annoying to me on my manual workouts. Not a deal breaker, just a minor annoyance. You can skip, but you have to wait for it to load.
Also, one day my internet was being dumb. I could not get my treadmill to start, even for a manual workout. This really upset me. If some chance the connection is shaky during the workout, it will still go but not save (if you are doing ifit it will just leave you where you left off and not change or save) so this is something that makes the treadmill not recommended if not using ifit.
I like the big screen. It has 2 spots on the side for cups or phones or whatever. I can also put my phone in the middle. The Bluetooth connects to my phones and the speakers are pretty good that I can still hear my music while running fast. It also has a tray underneath. I put my 3lb dumbbells there for a little extra for some walks.
I do like my treadmill, and I really like the ifit. But I don't think you should waste your money on this one if you don't plan on doing the ifit. It might start up right away without internet, but I really don't know."
"So far so good. I have had this treadmill (6.5 Si - 10 inch screen) for almost 4 months and it is still going strong. Putting it together was not difficult but it just took a while. The functionality is good for a light runner/walker. The iFit software is great and I have just completed a 6 week beginners running program. It really helps to give variety to working out on the treadmill. I had an issue where the iFit programming stopped and there is a way to submit an issue straight from the treadmill and it was resolved quickly. You need to have wifi to connect to and you can still use it without logging into iFit, but it comes with a free one year subscription and I was able to activate it without providing any credit card info. Without iFit, you still have some stat measured workouts like speed, distance, incline based workouts but it just shows a lap graphic screen or there are some map based screens. Not as exciting without the trainers motivating you but it is still good.
As far as treadmills go this one is a good one comparable to ones I used to use in gyms. Sure there are nicer ones but they are a bit more expensive."
The delivery was scheduled during checkout and came within 3 business days. Took me 2 hours with a 7 year old and 2 year old helping with a few STOP/leave it alone breaks. When I finished it took seconds to get this turned on and running. The treadmill is quiet smooth walking, faster than I need and overall a cool treadmill. Have not tried the iFit yet.
"I recently purchased this treadmill, in hopes of getting back in shape. Let me begin with it was not an easy treadmill to put together, it took my husband and I over an hour and a half to get it up and running. For the first 4 days that I used it, I loved it. I was even able to use it without the ifit option, by holding down the ifit button for 10 seconds and it opened so i could use it manually. So, on my 5th day of using the treadmill, I go to turn on the switch and the motor is running but the treadmill will not start. I, unplugged it several times, turned the reset switch off and on and still nothing. I have a call into NordicTrack for support. Will see how it goes. I will update once I get an answer.
Wednesday January 27, 2021, I had the treadmill pickup and returned to Amazon today. After talking to several people with NordicTrack and Amazon, I was advised to return the item. NordicTrack is a good brand, but I guess you could still find lemons there too. Good luck to you all, I hope you are able to find what your looking for."
"Warning! If you buy Amazon's expert assembly and want to return a defective item, they will make you disassemble it yourself.
As soon as we turned it on, it made a terrible noise that gets louder and louder as it increased speed - sounding like a jet engine. Something is definitely out of sorts with NordicTracks quality control. I paid for Amazon's expert assembly and they even tested it before ""approving it"" but they disregarded that it was obviously defective, which we found out only an hour after they left.
Other issues: the belt moved over to one side so i adjusted the tension to balance it out, hoping that would make it stop, but it did the same thing while the belt was perfectly centered. Very disappointing for a brand new treadmill. Would be much better off getting one locally from a Sporting goods store"
"Had I known about the ifit nonsense I certainly wold not have purcahsed this.
How dare you require me to go online and enter a credit card to activate a treadmill that i already paid for. What an awful company. Never again"
Followed instructions to the letter. Then, in step 16, instructions tells me to install covers over frame base. This step requires me to dissemble about 3/4 of what I just put together--this should have been step 2, not step 16. I am very irritated. I just left the covers off as they are purely cosmetic. Also the left tray would not attach because screw points were missing/broken off. So I glued it. Activation with ifit looked like it was going to be a bitch, but it turns out there is a bypass.
"Got it august 3,2020. Set up professionally 8/6/2020. Broke 12/10/2020. Customer service reps advised me to buy tools I didn't need and instructed me via video chat to attempt to remove parts not needed to. Waited 2 weeks and Replaced motor. Waited another 2 weeks and received a motherboard as it was still not working. Will only function if no one is standing or running on it at this point. Paid for 3 year protection plan. Upset that I have replaced the motor and motherboard within 4.5 months. Highly upset as the reliability and customer service via repairs has been a 2/10 so far. On hold for another 30 minutes currently. Hence why I am writing this review while I am waiting for them to answer.
I'd recommend to avoid these models and buy something cheaper"
"I bought this treadmill back in June of this year and was waiting a little bit to give my review. Even though it came with a tiny chip on the plastic cover on the right hand side (probably damage during transit), it's not such a big deal because it doesn't affect its functioning.
When I bought this treadmill, I wanted something that would be reliable, great quality, foldable, quiet and not so big that it wouldn't fit on the corner of my room. I have to say this treadmill checked all the boxes and even more. I am glad I took my time to do my research and decided on this treadmill.
As other reviews had mentioned, the box is really heavy, so make sure you have someone to help you with it. Thankfully I was lucky that my husband assembled it which didn't take that long to do it.
I made sure I bought a mat to protect my white floors.
I've been using this treadmill for a good 2 months now and I certainly love it. It is easy to fold and also easy to unfold. It is quieter than I had expected which is a win for me. I have attached a video for you to see.
The machine feels sturdy. It has 2 cup holders that are large enough to fit a bottle of water and even more. Incline and speed controls are on both sides of the front panel to select in intervals from 1-10 or if you wish to select a specific speed for example 3.1, you can adjust it in the controls that are at the bottom of the panel. Incline can also be adjusted the same way. I opted out of the iFit feature by following the instructions of other reviewers: hold down the iFit logo for 30 seconds and you'll be good. For me it took me probably less than 10 seconds but I held it down for more time to avoid any issues. I haven't been able to use the auxiliary music port yet because I mainly use my iphone and wireless ear buds for my workout.
In summary, I am absolutely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend others to buy it."
"I received the product quickly, no issues what-so-ever. It was packaged very well, and overall it seems pretty sturdy and well built. The delivery guys were super nice and helped me carry it inside. It's exactly what I wanted, except for:
You cannot use the treadmill until you create an account w/i-fit. It's completely locked out and dysfunctional until you register w/ifit. During the account creation, they require your credit card info (just in case you forget to cancel, so they can auto bill you each month and suck more money out of you). Upon creating the account you are then forced to download and install their stupid mobile app, and then use Bluetooth to unlock the treadmill, verifying they got their hands on your mobile device(s) as well. I tried to avoid this by calling support, but I was stuck on the customer supp lines in an infinite loop of ""you must create an ifit account before you can contact support, press 1"". Once the trial runs out, your treadmill is basically crap, and you're back to a limited set of features. So buying the treadmill isn't enough. You also need to sub to ifit, give them your email, credit card info, phone number & install their mobile app.
If I knew all this before I hit buy, I never would have bought it; and, I recommend you don't. In my opinion this type of crap is not only misleading to consumers, but it's just down right dishonest and bs. You should not be forced to dig through their fine print in order to ensure the product you're purchasing is what they depict it as online. I just wanted a treadmill. As a consumer, I paid for that treadmill. But, I got 1/2 a treadmill after my trial runs out. Additionally, I now have to hope they don't get hacked and lose my info as I rely on their ""infrastructure security"", which, conveniently, they do not openly disclose to me. It's not right."
The belt literally stops while it's going...even at higher speeds... I can stop it as I am walking... and as I step it will slip under my feet.. I'm not sure this is normal!?
I've had this treadmill for a week and it's safe to say it has exceeded my expectations. NordicTrack doesn't make junk. I was a little worried that at this price point it might be suited to walking only. No way! I've been running at a 4.5 -5.5 mph pace and it's incredibly sturdy. The folding feature is super easy. When you let the track down from the upright position it releases very slowly so as not to crush toes/kids/pets. The iFit feature is a slight annoyance, but just make sure the red safety key is in place and hold the iFit button for 30 seconds to disable. Worked like a charm for me. This is, by far, one of the best purchases I've made in years. The downside is that the machine is really heavy (200lbs) and, while I paid someone to do it for me, assembly sounded like a beast. I'd recommend paying for the assembly. Also, this NordicTrack isn't loud in comparison to the average treadmill at the gym, but it's still loud enough that I can't walk on it in an otherwise quiet house without waking up the baby sleeping in the next room. So, use that information as you will. Bottom line? I have no regrets about this purchase. I love this treadmill!
"Machine is well built, sturdy and easy to use.
***There are warnings all over the packages and instructions that state that you need to unlock your machine by signing up for an I-Fit membership** THIS IS NOT TRUE. All you need to do is: After the machine is assembled, Turn on the machine, press and hold the i-Fit button for 30 seconds, the machine will reset and you're good to go."
I bought a NordicTrack T6.5S treadmill for over $600 through Amazon and received it as expected. No issues with Amazon. I followed the user's manual on how to set it up, including purchasing a surge protector according to required specs, made sure it was the only device in the circuit, etc. It seemed to be a pretty good product but less than a month after receiving it, it stopped working. I filed a warranty claim with NordicTrack and received a response asking for a picture/video of the motor's LED lights; I emailed the video the next day, October 24th. It's been two weeks and I've received no response. I have submitted several requests for status... nothing. The only good thing I can say about it right now is that my cat likes to sit on it. If customer service finally comes through and provides some resolution, I will update my review.
"Update: ifit has charged us yet again, even though we have canceled twice... Please be aware if you buy this treadmill you'll be permanently stuck with a $15 monthly charge for a ridiculous app. My advice, but a plug and play and add what you actually want to from the thousands of free workout apps.
Treadmill is relatively easy to put together with decent instructions. It does take two people or one very savvy person to get it. It's definately not gym quality, but it works. When you step off to the sides to start and stop it feels like there is no support, but so far hasn't come crashing in on us!
The number one issue we had is that you CANNOT start the treadmill without first logging in and subscribing to ifit. Silly. The ifit isn't necessarily bad, but I want to make that choice, not be told I have no choice in the matter. Ifit Is also very hard to get unentangled from. You have to log in from a desktop... who has those anymore... and tell it 6 different ways you want to end the subscription.
In the end if I'd have realized that ifit was a must, and the sides and front of the machine were such cheap thin plastic I'd have spent a little more and got a better product"
"We just got our 9.5s today, so I'll have to update this review after using it for awhile.
First thoughts: assembly was a little tricky (we did it ourselves from the box), but no too bad.
The screen is gorgeous & touch works well.
Unlike some reviews has suggested, you do NOT have to have for an iFIT account to use the treadmill, but you won't be able to take advantage of all the features without one
It DOES come with a free 1 year iFIT family plan promo code
All in all, it's a nice machine. The only complaint I have so far is you can't use headphones with the unit: all you can do is pair your phone or tablet so you can play music (or whatever) through the unit's speakers. Even the included AUX cable is for input only."
"I only need a treadmill to run on days it's too cold/ hot to run outside. I bought the simplest Nordic Track T-Series because I did not require any extra features.* It's great so far with my maximum speed of 6.5 mph (yet I'm more in the zone of 5+ mph until I rebuild some speed and endurance!).
It's relatively quiet and, just for assurance, I padded the front legs through the middle roller (for now, with a repurposed yoga mat) to cushion on wood floors in an older 1940s home.
For a home treadmill, it recalls what I liked and needed the most from a gym machine. The lip on the display easily holds a magazine or an iPad. I really like to zone out and listen to music when I run, so all is well here.
Regarding assembly, I wish I added that option with delivery. A local handyperson helped me with most of it, yet at one point needed help stabilizing the treadmill while adding the hardware that helps it fold and re-lower. Three thoughts on this: 1) for safety, it's a two-person assembly, 2) don't overestimate how strong you are, and 3) when you discover how this treadmill lifts and lowers to save space, it makes you happy you bought this product! It gliiiiides down to the floor.
I am so happy this fits in my 2nd bedroom. The folding-up feature will help with guests in town.
*I heeded some reviewers' advice and held the i[???] button down for 30s. It worked? I was able to run and such without needing to subscribe to anything else. I already subscribe to a running app and try to keep myself accountable in other ways."
"First, thanks to reviewer who tells how to over ride activation to iFit by holding down iFit button for approximately 30 seconds until activation screen disappears and normal screen shows up. Great job, and I agree this is just a $s grab. Also, this unit is heavy and awkward to get into your house to setup and locate to final location. Based upon how beaten up, dented and crushed my box was, I would say transportation and delivery was an issue for everyone who touched it. Surprisingly only minor cosmetic crack in motor cover.
Assembly was harder than necessary because of manufacturing and design shortcuts taken by NordicTrack. Instructions were adequate but not great. Some machine threads were not done in the frame, so they supplied a self-threading machine screw. If unfamiliar with a thread cutting screw, I'm sure some would assume either the hole was too small or the screw was incorrect size. How easy would it have been for them to machine the threads. Also, some of the parts had smaller holes than the screw needed to pass thru to attach part to body of treadmill. Just sloppy parts forming. Some better and more detailed drawings for assembling would have helped. Two people is nice for speedier assembly, but one handy person can accomplish on their own. Final bug: the clip for the safety stop is incredibly cheap. It's like a paper clip. For a few pennies they could have had a clothespin type device that lived up to NordicTrack quality.
For the good. Once together, it's a great treadmill. Very solid. Lots of options. Easy to set and change while using tho controls for +/_ on side handles would have been a quality touch. Little to no bounce/sway. Lower noise level. Nice wide tread. Incremental speed by 0.1 mph from 1mph to 10mph. So, all in all, a great treadmill at $600. (Wait for it to be back in stock at Amazon and avoid those $880 prices)."
"Ok, so the first (and most important) point I want to make: YOU DO NOT NEED A SUBSCRIPTION TO IFIT FOR THIS TREADMILL TO WORK. This thing is PLASTERED with stickers that say the treadmill is ""locked"" and it wont work until you ""activate"" it, this is absolutely not true. Based on other commenters posting about this, I wasnt even going to buy this treadmill, but the other one I had my eye on wound up getting sold out, so I decided to take a leap of faith (hoping that the bypass methods mentioned in other comments would work) and I bought this one. So that being said, everything written in other comments is true - you can bypass the activation of IFIT and the treadmill works perfectly fine.
#2 - the treadmill was actually pretty easy to put together. I'd definitely say it was a two-person job. It took us maybe 2 hours. I dont know how anyone did it in 30 minutes, but maybe they have more experience than us.
#3 - it's REALLY quiet. Like, shockingly quiet. The last treadmill I owned was 15 years old, so maybe that's skewing my perspective a little, but I am very impressed with how quiet this thing is.
Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase."
"I have been looking for a treadmill for some time, since working from home in the age of Covid means I am more sedentary than I would like. I am nothing like an athlete. I am in my 70's and have some mobility problems so walking is essential but I am not likely to be running at any great speed. I do, however, prefer an incline.
This treadmill was a relatively good price. For the aforementioned reasons, I had no interest in the iFIT program and did not need a large screen. So I purchased the 5-inch screen which is far lower in price than the larger ones.
What I liked about this machine was:
1. It has a wide 22-inch belt which seemed safer and more comfortable than a narrow one
2. It supports 300 lb people which means it's sturdy and solid
Both of these appear to be accurate.
It's a heavy monster. I lavishly tipped the delivery drivers who graciously wrestled it down a flight of stairs for me. And I hired a fitness repair company to assemble it. Both were well-spent investments in my opinion. YMMV.
I also purchased a 3-year maintenance agreement. If you look at the prices on Amazon, they range all over the place for the same deal, so shop around. In my case, $89 got me a three-year agreement with a yearly preventive maintenance visit. Assuming it is fulfilled, it seems like a worthwhile investment.
There are elements of the unit that I do not love. The heart rate monitor does not seem accurate. The instructions are meh and the website is as well.
I avoided the iFIT scam because of the reviews here that noted that all I had to do was to hold down the start key for 30 seconds to bypass the credit card request. There is a big notice on the device that says STOP! and tells you that a credit card is required to start the machine. Not true and tacky.
At the end of the day, I spent less that $1000, including the extended warranty, delivery and assembly. I feel it was a good value and it appears to be a solid machine. It fits my needs well. It may or may not be what you need."
"Overall, it's a decent running machine for the price. But I have three problems with it. First, one of the screws (the silver screw used with the grounding wire) they gave me was the wrong type of screw and did not go into the hole. I had to use a drill to widen the hole and only then did it go through. Second, the machine shakes more than I anticipated. Some reviewers said it doesn't shake at all but it does. If you want a running machine that feels rock solid, you'll have to go with a more expensive model I'm afraid.
Third, and most importantly, there are numerous BOLD messages that tell you that you cannot unlock or start up the machine without registering at ifit.com. It's written everywhere and no where does it give you an exception. But as other reviewers have noted, you can bypass the ifit registration simply by putting in the red magnet key and holding the ifit button for 15 seconds. I agree with others that this is grossly misleading and may even qualify for false advertising. A major brand like NordicTrack shouldn't stoop to these gimmicks. They should do better.
Hence, my honest 3-star review. If I could give 2.5 stars I would."
We've owned this treadmill for 6 months now and absolutely love it. Glad I read the reviews that state how to disable the ifit program prior to purchase so there were no surprises. Definitely a lot harder to assemble this unit than I realized. I ended up hiring a professional to assemble it using the Thumbtack app. It cost me $80 and was well worth it. The only thing we've had to do maintenance wise is adjust the belt. The belt had shifted to one side and was rubbing against the side molding. I watched a 2 minute video on youtube that showed how to fix it easily. The instructions for how to align the belt on the nordictrack website were useless, so glad I found what I was looking for on youtube. I'm very happy with this purchase.
"Brief background on me, so you can compare your running style and needs to mine in your decision for this treadmill or another:
My details: mid-40s, 5'1"", small to medium build.
Running history: I've been consistently running 3 miles 4-6 times a week for over 20 years
Speed: At the moment, 8:30 to 8:45 minute miles (I'd like to get back to 8:00 to 8:15 minute miles, though)
Style: Almost entirely treadmill running, which has allowed me to avoid major injuries and strains.
When the gyms closed due to the pandemic I was forced to take my running outside, which left my feet, ankles, and knees aching. I knew I needed a treadmill. I am a treadmill fanatic, having run on many over the years. I am very picky about what I like and don't like and knew what I wanted: a durable treadmill with good shock absorption which would stand up to almost daily use. I ended up choosing the NordicTrac T Series with the 5-inch screen. I have had this treadmill for over two weeks now and have run on it almost every night since I got it. It meets and exceeds my needs in almost every way.
Pros:
Running is very comfortable, the shock absorption is very good--I noticed a difference right away in how my legs and feet felt compared to running outside. It has been comfortable every night I have run on it, no aches or strains.
It sits flat--I absolutely hate running on a treadmill that is slightly inclined when it is supposed to be at a 0 grade. If you've ever experienced this you know what I'm talking about.
The size is comfortable, plenty of room on the belt--but I am short so take that into consideration.
The screen allows me to track my distance in either laps (.25 miles per lap) or with a standard distance tracker. I'm a total nerd about tracking my pace and this shows distance to the thousandths spot rather than the more usual tenths and hundredths (i.e. it shows you have run 1.457 miles rather than 1.45 or 1.4). It's dumb, but I love this feature.
The speed and incline buttons are intuitive and user-friendly in their positioning on the console.
It's very easy to fold up and pull down.
 You can crank it up for a hard run or interval training. I have it up to 8 mph on occasion and there is no wobble or shake.
 The range of incline is good and the movement up and down is smooth. If inclines are your thing you should have plenty to work with here.
 The price was right--for a treadmill of this caliber it was a great deal. Higher-end commercial-grade treadmills can be upwards of two grand or more, and this was less than half that.
Cons:
 During assembly there were a couple of times where the screws almost or just didn't quite fit where they were supposed to. We ""fixed"" it by brute force and a drill, but it was frustrating at the time.
 I do wish this version had a fan, but you can always purchase one to attach to the treadmill if you need one.
 The heart-rate monitor is useless, but whatever.
Unknowns:
 I haven't tried the speakers. I watch my tablet or listen to music/podcasts on my phone and use headphones. The shelf for your tablet is really nice though, for what that's worth. UPDATE: I tried them, they're pretty terrible. Definitely don't rely on them. They are too quiet and the sound quality is pretty bad.
To summarize, this is a worthwhile investment if you want a solid treadmill for your running routine (or if you're looking to make running part of your daily life). I'm extremely happy with it and will be using it for my daily run from here on out.
UPDATE:
I've been using the treadmill about 5 times a week or so since I bought it a couple of months ago, so I thought I would update on how it's holding up (if that is useful). Overall, still sturdy and comfortable. Still very kind to my knees and ankles, which is important to me. No issues with shaking or squeaking.
Two issues I do notice:
1. the belt has a tendency to slide to one side or the other while running, so I have to keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't get chewed up by sliding too far. Adjusting the belt does help but it still does slide. For whatever reason, once the machine seems to be warmed up and I am running faster, the sliding is much less of a problem. (Also, as a side note, the last home treadmill we had was far more prone to sliding than this one--it may just be something endemic to home treadmills).
2. On occasion when I switch the treadmill on it goes all the way through an incline cycle. By this I mean the platform raises itself as far as it can and then lowers itself again. Then it's fine and I start my run.
I would not deduct from my original rating for these issues. It's still a great treadmill and I'm so happy not to have to go to the gym right now!"
I purchased this item for only $599 before the weather got cold. My wife and I dropped our membership at the local fitness center last March because of COVID risk. We went to our local city park to exercise during the spring, summer and early fall weather. With the risk still high, I started shopping for something we could use during the winter. I had owned the Nordic Track ski machine for several years but at 72, I don't have the wind to use it anymore. I looked at the Nordic Track web site and then checked Amazon. I got a great deal on the model I purchased because it has a much smaller screed display than the current models. I wasn't interested in the iFit features so the smaller screen was fine. I paid for assembly but when the guys showed up (without masks) I decided to just assemble it myself. I had them unbox it and put the heavy parts inside the door. They were really nice guys so I didn't even consider asking for a refund on the assembly. It took me 4 hours to assemble it, mostly because I was working in a pretty confined space. I did register for the 1 month of free iFit rather than using a simple override. It's a good thing I did because the machine comes set to metric as the default distance setting. I switched it to miles on the iFit site and it retained the setting. The machine is heavy and seems to be very high quality. I plug my iPhone into it to play music while I workout and the speakers a surprisingly great. I had to do a good bit of tinkering to get the belt to stay centered but it's fine now. There is a very intermittent squeak and I have not been able to get rid of it in spite of YouTube videos on lubricating a few points. I'm betting that when the machine gets a few more hours on it, it will stop. We are using the machine in a pretty confined area but once we put it in the storage position, it doesn't interfere with using the area. Overall, we love the machine and the build quality should provide us with many years of usage and at the price I paid, it was a true steal.
"I bought this to work out at home during the pandemic.
I have been using it 30mn a day for 2 months without any issue.
I like the safety side which relies on a small cord attached to a magnet which gets pulled and shuts down the treadmill if you stand to far back on the tread.
You need at least 2 persons to assemble it.
I personally am not interested in iFit and I prefer watching TV while exercising.
When you open and setup the treadmill, there are notes and signs that tell you yo register with iFit to start.
As explained by one of the other reviewers, you do not have to register with iFit: the first time you start the treadmill, press the iFit button for about 20 seconds and then you will be able to use the treadmill normally.
I am not a fitness addict but I feel this treadmill from a trusted company is worth every penny and at a price significantly lower that many other models."
"Pros
Incline adjusts from 0-10 and speed from .5 MPH to 10 MPH
Easy to fold, even for a 5' granny like me and unfolds with lift assist cylinder
Fairly easy to assemble, I did it with my grandson. The hardest part was the screw for the ground wire
Rapid response to speed adjustments
Easy to access the drive motor area (Had a wonky connection and Customer Support walked me through it) so it looks like maintenance will be a breeze
Most treadmills at this price range do not have incline adjustment or very little. This one has 0-10
I watch my tablet when using the treadmill and the ledge for it is large enough that I don't worry about the tablet bouncing off
It's great to have 2 cup holders - I use one for my iPhone to monitor my heartrate with a MyZone belt. The Pulse Rate on the treadmill is usually pretty close to my chest strap readings, although sometimes wildly off.
Neutral - I did not use the iFit feature so I cannot comment on that.
Cons
The audio is horrible - really very little volume. Use your headphones
The display is very small. That is a non-issue with me. When using the treadmill I stream Amazon Prime or Netflix videos to my Fire tablet.
Overall impression - It's a great basic treadmill without a lot of bells and whistles. It's made for you to work out, not watch TV or play music. You've got other devices to do that!"
"Pros
-Easy to put together but had a few things come up during the build. You do need two people at one point when attaching the folding guide rod. The cable you also fish through was confusing on one step where it should go. I took a picture for reference.
-Very quit, maybe I have not bought a new treadmill in awhile but I don't have to blast the tv to ear over the unit.
-A simple interface makes it easy to do quick changes to incline and speed.
-Easy on the knees so far, it seems like the treadmill takes my impact fine.
-The calorie counter seems more accurate.
Update: Another feature I realized is that if I accidentally pull the safety clip it will remember my spot instead of losing everything, distance, time etc.
Cons
Really I have to unlock the treadmill through an app that I first have to register and give a credit card to for iFit? I mean give me a break. I canceled the account right after creating it. I just shouldn't have to do this. There is a number you can do it over the phone but I didn't try that just used the app.
I am not 100% convinced this folding lock is safe compared to my last one. I mean there is no pin to lock it in place just the rod that you push with your foot. I could see a kid knocking it. I mean it does come down slow enough they should be able to get out of the way but I am not sure how often I will have this in a folded position.
Update: I had some issues with the incline getting caught on the bolt coming down. It looked like comparing the lift bracket to the other side the one on the left was bent a little too far out. I did have to use a rubber mallet to get it over just the little bit so I could go up and down on the incline without it getting stuck."
"Pleasantly surprised it was delivered a few days early. Installation manual was actually quite good, detailed and correct. The reason for 2 stars is the quality of parts and service. Most items requiring lots of screws, nuts and such, usually would pack extra in case of anything. Not NordicTrack, they gave only the exact count. There was a special screw for the ground wire, and as I screwed it in, the tip broke off. Then, I was unable to screw in one of the screws needed to attach the display to the handrail because the screw had metal in the groove so that I can't get the screwdriver in. Never seen defective screws like this. I called NordicTrack, and it was going to take them 7-10 business days to get ONE screw to me. I chose NordicTrack for its supposed name brand, but the lack of quality control and service was disappointing.
Update: I'm lowering to 1 star because it's been 2 weeks and I am still waiting for ONE screw."
"When researching this treadmill, I saw a lot of negative reviews. I realized that all of the negative reviews were due to Nordic Track's partnership with iFit. I was a little apprehensive about having to deal with iFit but decided I would give it my all. A few months later, I can say that I am not a fan of iFit. It was hard to use and would take so long to start the workout that i felt I'd rather just do without it. It wasted my time (taking so long to load) and would be a source of frustration. Therefore, I unsubscribed after the first free month and thankfully, that's was quick and easy.
As for Nordic track, I recently purchased my very first treadmill from them. However, I'm very familiar with Nordic track. I've witnessed my cousin using a Nordic track treadmill for years! She raves about its durability, comfort, and quality. I am excited to finally be able to start my own journey with Nordic Track.
Finally, At checkout I choose to pay Amazon an extra fee in return for delivering the machine to room of choose. Upon arrival, the delivery company was unwilling to take it up the stairs (the stairs were included in the package I paid for). I had an impossibly heavy treadmill sitting in my front room for a few days. Amazon was unsympathetic about this and were unwilling to help, even though I had paid to have them take it up the stairs. In the end, they refunded the amount and my husband and I carried it up the stairs. It was back-breaking work but well worth it."
I received this Nordic Track treadmill back in November 2020 and am so grateful to find one in stock that would ship directly to my home. Our old treadmill lasted about 18 years so we weren't looking for anything fancy with big screens to follow along with workouts but just a good quality machine with an easy to use display. It took a little time to put together but my husband was able to follow all the instructions and got it assembled in an afternoon. One part was broken in shipping and it was easy to use the customer service links on the order to request a replacement part, which we received after about a month. We weren't upset because it was right around Christmas when all shipping carriers were delayed. The treadmill folds very easily, the display buttons are large and easy to see, the machine is heavy duty and responsive to incline and speed changes. I've seen a lot of complaints about the iFit claims included with the machine that you MUST create an account to use it. All it took was a little research to discover that is NOT the case and all you have to do is follow these easy instructions to bypass that: hold down the iFit logo on the treadmill for 30 seconds and your treadmill will work. It has other features like internal speakers and heart rate monitor that I don't use, since I wear a Fitbit and use my laptop and wireless headphones to watch TV and movies while I work out but this treadmill is definitely a great value for the price!
There was one tiny screw missing for a wire grounding so it wasn't a big deal (since the screw is super tiny and had a substitute screw that didn't fit as well but you could put tape around it so it wouldn't fall out for the grounding - I may use my warranty soon to ask if they can look at that part), but this product is extremely well made: the usability is super easy with the button options and monitoring tools (love the space it saves because you can push up the tred for more floor space) and the assembly is very easy with the organize instructions and pictures and organized packaged tools. Running on it is smooth and doesn't hurt the floor.
"Not to bad to setup. I think it took me around two hours alone and taking my time. The box had one tear in it but nothing was damaged - shipped on a pallet. My only problem with shipping was they did not deliver it to the room like I paid for. I eventually dropped it on my foot getting it into place and two weeks later it is still having slight pains. Amazon refunded the fees for me though. The company was Pilot, so if you end up with them know they are taking covid measures seriously and won't help you out.
treadmill itself:
-its nothing fancy - the screen looks like its from the 90s
-the speaker is garbage
-the floor board seems cheap, but works so far(kinda loud) - with AirPods pros noise cancelling I still hear it
-the cupholders seem dysfunctional? maybe I haven't figured them out yet, but everything rattles very loudly. I have went around and given everything a retighten as well
-the fold up shock works nicely
-the quick speed settings are nice
- seems to take awhile to slow down - such as 8.0 to 4(slow jog) or 2(walk) which is somewhat jolting and dangerous
-heart rate monitors don't seem to work well
That's all I can think of. overall not bad. beats paying double the price to run in place"
"I must say, I read the good.. the bad..the ugly. I had major anxiety while building this as the negative reviews were flying through my mind. Once I plugged the machine in and started it up I was in fact able to bypass the iFit membership and was so happy! I pressed speed 2 and man is this thing peppy. It picked up fast!
Overall, the machine feels solid... it is not eating up the small room it is in as it is a great size. It lifts and comes down with ease to save space.
My ONLY con..the incline seems a bit outdated. If you do interval training you may have to alter the amount of time you walk or run on that incline to account for the amount of time it took to get to that incline.
I am relieved that I did not experience any of the horrors other customers seem to have. I would 100% recommend if you need something basic but solid for your home."
"iFit is engaged in a coercive, deceptive relationship with nordictrack. You are REQUIRED to provide a credit card and pay $1 to simply start the thing. After you have gone through the trouble of ordering, delivering, assembling, now you are REQUIRED to subscribe to the ifit service to simply start the thing! There is no way to decline the service. You have to create an ifit account, provide your credit card details, accept a $1 charge, accept you will be charged $15/month, and then install an app on your phone to start the thing. If you were as put off as I was, then you immediately, turn around and try to log back in, and trudge around looking for how you can ""End Benefit!"" Also, now they have your CC info! So I cancelled that CC account to protect that information.
Now about assembly. The instructions need a lot of work. There is a table at the front that provide numbers to the parts that correspond to the diagrams, but are not referenced with the parts package. Simply continuing the numbering reference to the parts package would have taken care of it. After finally getting the thing assembled, we noticed that the frame was not square and would not sit on the floor squarely; one foot was always in the air. So we had to jump on it a few times to get it to bend back to square.
So now that we have it assembled, ACTIVATED, and SQUARED, we can attempt to use it... Writing this review has been very therapeutic; thank you Amazon. Update to follow.
1st update. We had this just two days. It did something strange today. We turned it on and it immediately began to rise. Once it reached the top it began to lower. Once it got to the bottom, it just stopped, waiting to be used. It was just weird. Thought I should mention it. Otherwise it seems to be working normally now."
"I use my NT treadmill every other day for approximately the past 4 months. Sturdy, quiet. I would definitely buy it again. You can't beat the price for quality, and the payment option is appreciated. Caution - you definitely want to have an experienced technician assemble it unless you have the time and some 'handyman' skill. A second person might also be a benefit. Instructions are fairly clear.
Criticisms: adjusting the belt tension is an aggravation and necessary. There needs to be a guide tube to enable easy insertion of the allen wrench (provided) into the two hidden sockets. Especially considering the need to lubricate (by loosening) the belt on the platform every 3 months. A smaller criticism, the platform on each side could be a couple inches wider to comfortably put your feet. I appreciate that the design is to be as narrow as possible. It's a great machine overall."
"Per the headline, I've had my machine for 3 weeks now and am loving every minute of it. The only reason I had a gym membership was to use their treadmill. I canceled that after only 2 workouts on this machine. Below are the details of my experience from purchase to assembly:
Purchase: As some reviewers have stated the treadmill is a bear to assemble by yourself (which is what I did). However, if you have a competent friend/family member willing to give you an hour of their time I would bypass the professional assembly. However, DEFINITELY pay the extra $20 for in-house/desired room delivery (even if you live in a one-story house). The box the treadmill comes in weighs about 200 lbs. You do not want to try maneuvering it around your house/apartment without help.
Delivery: As stated above, I use the desired room delivery. The Amazon delivery service was on-time, professional and capable (although I did have to help the guys get the box around a tricky corner in my building's staircase). They called once when they were on their way to my location, and again as they were pulling. I've always been gun-shy about purchasing large items on Amazon, but if this is the level of service one can expect from their delivery service I may do so more often.
Assembly: Again, assembly can be done with one person (it's in no way easy, and you should be able to lift at least 50 lbs by yourself), but I don't recommend it. However, having gone through the steps there wasn't anything that I thought would warrant paying an extra $70 for a professional to come do. Just make sure you have a Phillips-head screwdriver, and either a socket wrench (with plenty of socket heads) or an adjustable wrench. All other tools needed come with the treadmill. As others have stated some of the bolts are in hard to reach spots. Take your time, follow the instructions and assembly shouldn't take more than an hour. Pro Tip: there's no need to purchase a mat for the bottom of the treadmill (to protect your floor) if you're strapped for cash. When you take the top off the box, simply cut off the side pieces, put the belt/motor component on the top and use it as your floor protection. The cardboard doesn't slide/slip at all when you're on the treadmill.
Usage: Unlike some others I actually bought this machine FOR the iFit functionality. I have an iFit account and absolutely love the service. From what I read you can cancel the membership (almost immediately) after the machine has been activated. Personally I love just being able to focus on my run/walks and let the machine self-adjust speed and incline on its own. Full disclosure though...you really don't need an iFit membership to take advantage of this function. While you can manually adjust settings like any gym treadmill, this machine comes with (I think) 20 preset workouts that also self-adjust. I haven't used any of them yet, but from scrolling through the menus they look pretty varied in terms of challenge level. The machine is quieter than any gym treadmill I've ever used. I workout watching TV and routinely run at 6 mph without having to adjust the TV's volume. Transitions between incline and speed levels is smooth and natural. I also love that you can adjust the cushyness/firmness of the belt.
Storage: The treadmill doesn't take up that much space. It's a little shorter than a child's twin bed (probably about the same width). While it can be folded you really don't save that much space with the belt/bed up (since it rests at a angle that's only slight shorter than the length when fully deployed). I generally leave it down and ready to use.
Overall I'm extremely happy with this purchase. I haven't any issues or complaints 3 weeks in, but appreciate the length of the warranties that come standard with the treadmill (I did however buy the 3-year maintenance plan ). I would definitely recommend this machine without reservation!"
"We bought this treadmill to get cardio in during COVID-19 lockdown, and are very happy with it. For the price paid, it is very high quality and a great value. The machine was packed very well for shipping. I recommend registering the product as soon as you get it built.
My wife is pretty happy with it. It does appear to move faster than the treadmills on a similar speed setting at the health club. The belt was slightly misaligned to the right, but I found an online support article showing how to make a few turns with the allen wrench to center, super easy! The stride length is very good for us both, so we never feel like we're going to fall off the back. The electronics are attractive and simple to operate. Belt operation is smooth and relatively quiet.
The treadmill releases very easily to fold up if you need to move it out of the way. We have dedicated a space in our media room for it, so this is less important to us. Assembly took maybe an hour, and the instructions were very easy to follow.
The only complaint I have about the workouts is I wish the arm support bars extended a bit further back. I find that when resting my hands on them, I have to orient my body a bit too far forward, and the tips of my shoes will sometimes tap on the kick panel covering the front of the belt. Also, there are some rough edges to the plastic where they were removed from the mold right at the end of the hand rests so I need to file those down - very minor annoyance.
I don't use the ifit.com subscription - you can disable this as others have noted on first use by holding down the iFIT button and letting the machine reset itself, maybe 30 seconds. I prefer to watch movies or listen to music while using so this was not a feature that mattered to me.
Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and with the support from NordicTrack!
Pros:
+ Quality/sturdy construction
+ Ease of assembly
+ Fluid motion/incline
+ Excellent support
+ Attractive design
+ Great value/price
+ Well packaged!
+ Easy to fold up/move (wheels are great)
Cons
- iFIT unnecessary IMO
- wish arm rests were a bit longer
I would not hesitate to buy this treadmill if you're considering one in this price range."
"First and foremost FOLLOW OTHERS ADVICE. The thing will beep at you like crazy in attempts to resist and they have put flyers all over it claiming to sign up for IFit to unlock it. Hold the Ifit button for 30 seconds to unlock no need to pay. shameless scam. absolutely disgusting
Instructions say need 2 people to assemble this is not a joke. If you are not a handy person DO NOT BUY THIS. They don't provide you the correct tools to assemble, the pieces don't fit together properly, the screws don't fit any of the holes, and the parts are cut wrong too big or to small. The parts in the shrink rap are labeled wrong, the instructions refer to the wrong parts and wrong locations.
I consider myself very handy; the horrible design, poor production and lack of attention to anything that might be considered ""detail"" made this a horrific profanity laced 2.5 hour assembly. The ""assembly"" comprised of having to force pieces together, use an impact drill to get enough torque to get screws INTENDED FOR DISCARD out of the damn holes and then to get the intended screws that were too big to fit in the hole into place.
I can't rail hard enough about how horrific the design on this nightmare of a product was. You would think NordicTrack as a recognizable brand would mean quality. FAR FROM IT.
Once it was together it appears to work as designed although it leaves plenty to desire in aesthetics, options and software quality. User friendly 3/5.
This product is lazily designed, slapped together and farted out for consumers to hate every life choice that led them to this nightmare.
Is it a Treadmill? Yes
Is it also a demon spawn sent to torture your last cell of sanity? Also yes
Is it a blatant scam that they company has still refused to rectify? Also, Also yes."
"1. Takes long time to assemble and it takes two common skilled people to put together.
2. Folding is a joke. When it folds up, it only folds to about 60 degrees. Not straight up 90 degrees to get out the way.
3. Trying to move it while it is folded is impossible because of how awkward it folds and where wheels are positioned.
4. I am 6'1"". The front and side grips are way too low to hold onto while walking so useless you want to hunch way over while walking.
5. The heart monitor is useless. It always reads in the 80's and 90's.
6. The sides of the belt where you step off to take a break while the belt is still moving are useless. They are dangerous because they are angled towards the belt and are way too thin to get your entire foot on them. Try stepping on them and part of your foot is still on the moving belt which can make you fall on your face.
I am very disappointed in this purchase.
All these good reviews are either fake or from short people who never need to fold it, move it, use the heart monitor, or use the side steps."
I assembled the treadmill with great deal difficulties. When I turned the tread mill, I heard brushing noise with out anyone running on it. Attempted to call Nordic, it took me 4 hours to get my message to them. I get the e-mail from Nordic asking me to trouble shoot by removing many parts of the treadmill. My question is they are asking me to troubleshot brand new treadmill? It should have been checked before the tread mill left the factory. Even registering the warranty on their site is a head ache. When you spend over $1000, you should get a quality product. Hope Nordic stand behind their name and reputation. They have very limited online hours for trouble shooting resolution.
"First of all, I would like to mention that my husband and I were very happy that our treadmill arrived earlier than we expected and the packaging was in very good condition, no big gouges in the box. Thus, we felt confident that the treadmill did not suffer any kind of damage during transport. We removed all parts from the packaging and assembled the treadmill. It requires 2 people to assemble this treadmill, but it's not complicated or confusing as the instructions are clear and easy to follow.
I've been using this treadmill at least 3 times per week for 3 months now and I have been very satisfied with its performance. I find the treadmill to be sturdy and it doesn't make any annoying sounds while in use. I like that there are 2 ways for adjusting incline and speed. The only feature that I wish the treadmill included is a cooling fan. However, I have remedied this by placing a small fan in front of the treadmill to cool me while I'm working out. I actually look forward to my work outs even more now that I own this treadmill."
I chose this mode because it seemed to be one of the most reasonable priced in the 200+lb weight limit family, and it was a good name brand I felt I could trust. Put it together myself, it's definitely a project and you'll need a second set of hands to help hold things in place. My first issue is how you have to bypass the ifit subscription which other reviewers have mentioned. You do that by holding down the logo button as others have said. But more so than that I'm only about 5'9 and I feel like I'm too tall for it. Especially the handles and the screen and all of it. My second major issue is how far out the plastic comes on the top part over the track, because of this the handles don't come out far enough so you're stomping on the plastic when you try to hold onto the handles. It's a really big design flaw in my opinion. The track also is jumpy and not smooth at all. It seems to go WAY faster than other treadmills. The 1 speed is extremely slow but 3 is a full on brisk jog, I can't imagine what 10 is.
Like a lot of people who were used to using the cardio in the gym, this virus lockdown was problematic. We bought this early into the stay at home orders in CA. Given the relatively low price I was concerned about it being stable-but it is plenty solid for us. We use it primarily for fast walking but I put 6-7 miles on it a day (sometimes more). Don't expect what you can get for 3-5 thousand (it isn't like a gym model-but functions similarly). Nice incline, good read out. If you are fairly handy-can use simple hand tools and carefully follow instructions, you can do the build yourself. There are a couple of places a second set of hands helps. It is a process-I think it took me a couple hours (and I build things a fair amount). The reviews that tell you not to fall for the attempt at selling the on line trainer crap are accurate. After you get it set up just hit the blue ifit button and it will bypass the screen that has you enter the code to sign up. Once you do this the machine stays in manual mode and you wont have to mess with it again. If you want the ifit thing you get more functionality out of the preset controls-but all I want to do is walk, jog and incline sometimes. There is also a pair of speakers that you can aux cord connect to (would be nice if it was blue tooth). There is a small shelf on the monitor that you can put your iPad on. Overall, super happy with this for the price.
I was looking for a high quality treadmill for jogging/walking that had simple features. I've used really good treadmills at various gyms and wasn't willing to use a cheap-feeling treadmill. It is great quality. It is easy to use with manual features (increase speed, incline, etc.), but also offers shortcut buttons to quickly get up to speed/use programs. You can track all the basics (calories, distance, etc.) from the treadmill. I started out by using the iFit app, which is pretty simple to use, but decided to discontinue my subscription because I enjoy pretty basic, quick walks/runs. Other people wrote reviews about issues cancelling iFit but I had absolutely no issue and was glad I tried out various programs. It was nice to know I have the option in the future if I want it. Assembly takes a bit of time, but I don't think that's uncommon for workout equipment. Overall happy with the quality and functionality.
"The Nordictrack T6.5 Si arrived on time and in one very long and heavy reinforced cardboard box. It took two delivery men to bring it inside my house. With the help of another person, I wanted to get it upstairs but we had trouble maneuvering this 209lb unit in its large box around a turn in my staircase, so I decided that it would go in my office on the main floor. No problem there. I carefully followed the instructions and found them to be extremely well-written and with adequate detail. If you prefer to use a video to help build it, there is a free App called BILT that has this unit in their catalog and it follows the same exact steps as the written guide but with the addition of some nice 3D images that you can rotate. It took me about 3 hours to assemble but I worked slowly and double checked all steps. For someone who has built one, it might take 1-1/2 hrs. Once assembled, I was able to login using my home Wifi and immediately it told me that there was an available firmware update. No issue updating, but it took a good 10 minutes or so to complete it. I logged in using the included 1 year free iFit family membership and added myself and my wife as users. There is an option to bypass the iFit membership but why do that if 1 year is totally free? After that, I calibrated the incline as per instructions and that worked out fine.
I have tried two of the iFit level 1 (the easiest!) workouts and I loved them! First I took a walk called ""Niagara River Cultural Walk"". This was 0.85 miles in duration and basically mostly flat with a few includes up to 2%. I love the way that the machine adjust walking speed and incline automatically and the instructor provided an excellent overview of the area while walking along with you. The next day I tried a different walk ""Inner Crater Walk, Rano Raraku, Easter Island"" (0.71 miles). This one was also level 1 but slightly more challenging as the incline went up to 6% but still a relatively simple and easy workout. The instructor gave a great overview of the history and the views were spectacular. Not quite like being there but very nice and easy to see on the 9"" built-in LCD monitor.
What I like (so far):
* A very nice solid machine, well-built and sturdy. It looks good and is almost as sturdy as those expensive ones at the Gym.
* This model was in stock at Amazon even though it was on backorder at Nordictrack's own website (go figure!). I got it something like 4 days after ordering.
* I found a better price on Amazon (check several vendors - as price varies). In fact it was lower than direct from Nordictrack.
* Great instructions on assembly and very easy to follow. There is a step that recommends two people for safety reasons.
* Love the iFit App. I know this isn't a material part of the treadmill but it certainly makes using it a lot more fun. Anyone that bypasses this App is losing out.
What I didn't like (so far)
* The built-in Android tablet boots up slowly and some of the touch screen functions seem slow to react. Not a big issue but it is a bit slower than modern technology should be.
* No Bluetooth to connect audio from an external device to the built-in speakers. There is a 1/4"" jack socket so you can use a (not included) cable. Haven't tried that yet.
* The built-in handlebar for measuring pulse rate seems to be very erratic. During the walks I took it wandered from 49 (too low) to 177 (way too high) but occasionally it seemed to be about right. You can buy a chest pulse rate monitor which I am guessing will be more accurate.
Overall, I really like this treadmill, I think it was a great purchase. Recommended."
I've had my treadmill for a couple weeks now, and it's not great but good enough for what I spent. The console is nice, and it comes with 1 free year of I-Fit which is pretty cool (although I doubt I will renew it because the renewal costs more than a gym membership). The features are nice, and the treadmill seems solid. Here are the problems. The heart rate monitor doesn't work at all. I have an Apple Watch so I can live without it, but it's listed as a feature and doesn't work. I can be drenched in sweat, panting and my Apple Watch is registering a heart rate of 165, and the treadmill bounces back and forth between 58 and 62 BPM. Another flaw is the area on the front of the tread is too short, if I hold onto the heart rate monitor rail my foot steps land on the cowl that covers the front of the tread. I weigh 185, and it seems the treadmill slows down a very small amount every time my weight comes down on it. It's definitely not as robust as the ones at the gym, but in fairness the cost is much less. It is very slow to transition between inclines. It takes nearly a minute to go from 0 incline to 10. Overall I'm happy with it, it's good enough to burn some calories on days when I don't feel like a trip to the gym. It's pretty quiet.
I can't even begin to explain how much I LOVE this machine!!!! I do feel like it's important to mention that it was very difficult for my husband to put together and he's been a carpenter for 15 years so he's really handy. Also, once it was all assembled, it wasn't working properly so I contact tech support at Nordictrack. They were very patient and helpful and worked through multiple troubleshooting techniques for over an hour. Unfortunately, the problem was deeper than the surface so we couldn't fix it. They apologize multiple times and sent out a new console which I got about 5 days later. I connected the new one and it works great! I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! The workouts really keep you engaged and the fact that the machine does all of the work in terms of adjusting the speed and incline makes things so much easier! I don't have any joint pain so I feel like the suspension works really week. I got the 10 inch screen (T-series 6.5 Si) and the screen is roughly the size of an iPad - much larger in person than it looks in the picture - plus the video clarity is great!!!
"The treadmill was delivered on time and in perfect condition. Assembly took about 2 hours and was very simple. The treadmill looks great and the touchscreen is gorgeous, but without iFit is loses a lot of the appeal. The big problem is that the 1-year subscription to iFit is nowhere to be found, and NordicTrack (icon fitness) have horrendous customer service. It took over 24 hours to get a response which was just a canned request for my activation number to ""look into the issue"". If I had the promo/activation code I wouldn't need to contact you!
From a functional standpoint the unit seems good. It's solid and runs fairly quiet, but the missing iFit subscription really hurts the value proposition. It does seem like other people have received their code, so your mileage may vary, but if this is an indication of how customer service works you better pray the machine never breaks."
Very glad I picked this one after studying so many of them. For $599 you get a quality treadmill with a very basic information screen. Treadmill section is high quality. However that basic 5" screen will display everything you'll need to know during your workout. And believe me when I say "you DO NOT have to register for, and pay extra for iFit to use this treadmill. Once I first held the iFit button down for about 20 seconds I never had to do that again. Everytime I power it up I get on it, set my speed and start walking.
"I have this a three star review for a few reasons. None of which deals with the function of the product.
First, the ""timed"" delivery was two days early. While this was a positive, it was completely unexpected. The drivers were very curtious. They even brought it into my apartment, rather than leaving it in the hallway as requested.
Once they left, I inspected the box. It was completely damaged. There was pieces of the box missing, and the product was actually exposed. I immediately contacted Amazon and confirmed it was safe to open the box.
While my husband assembled the treadmill, there was a piece of the base that was broken. We completed the assembly. The dimensions they provide in the description are for the deck only. This became a problem, since I live in a small apartment. I pre-planned the designated space for this. This was pointless. So we rearranged our living room for it.
That being said, we've used it several times now. It works flawlessly. I like the functions. I don't subscribe to their workout thing. I feel the main console is way oversized. The heart rate monitor is not acurate, but neither of us use it. Overall, I think it is a good treadmill. Just didn't enjoy the ""set up""."
I am an avid runner (65+ yrs) and my wife is an avid treadmill walker at the YMCA. We both have been considering getting a treadmill back into the home as an alternative to the Y and, yes, I will run on it when the weather is bad outside. We wanted to keep the price point to below $1K and after a bit of research decided on this model. It arrived on time and after I gently got the heavy device down to the basement I assembled it within 2 hours. Thanks to some prior Amazon posts, I knew to press and hold the iFit button to activate without having to enroll in the iFit subscription. The product registration is separate. The treadmill is great. Purchased the floor pad as well. We don't need all the iFit extras. This is simple to operate and nice to have now that we are all locked down. Happy Trails!!
I bought this NordiTrack Treadmill and I absolutely love it. I put it together all by myself (I'm a girl) and I had no problems. I did have some defective part issues but I was still able to use my treadmill while waiting for replacement parts (FREE OF CHARGE) NordiTrack customer service went above and beyond to provide me with the utmost in customer service. I also enrolled in the iFit on demand work outs. It is NOT necessary to Purchase any packages to make your treadmill work so please don't be frustrated. I am so happy I bought this treadmill. It will be will me in use for as long as I'm alive. ðŸ¥°
"Disable iFit: press & hold iFit button (should hear one beep) and console will boot up & bypass iFit sign-up. If you hear some R2D2 type stuff, take your finger off and try again.
**Note**
Assembly was pretty easy, I did it myself and took my sweet time with it. Be mindful that the console support bar comes attached to the console. I almost went Hulk thinking I was missing a part and the instructions make no mention of having to remove it from the console to install on the upright arms.
Aside from the above, I love it!!! Cardio is key to good health. Noise is on par with others I've used. I am somewhat tall with a long stride and heavy landing feet. Its nothing that will drive you crazy or anger the neighbors. Pressing & holding the numbered speed keys will increase in .4 increments ( from 4 to 4.4),(no clue why it wouldn't be .5 but its cool). No need for a fan on a treadmill lol thats silly, same with some fancy lcd screen. Running is about zoning out and getting lost in your mind, not having a fan hit your face while watching youtube. Easy to adjust & center the belt. You will need assistance to install the parts under the belt assembly. I've owned a Nordic Track treadmill in the past which is why I got this one. They are built very well and assuming you arent trying to be Usain Bolt, should hold up 5-7yrs easy."
"2 things very wrong with this item. 1st, the price fluctuates by ~$400 week to week. If you bought it (the cheapest one with 5"" screen) for ~$1080, YOU GOT RIPPED OFF AND ARE KICKING YOURSELF!!!!!! I paid $637. A week later it was $1090, today it's $720. I would be livid if I found out the following week that I overpaid by $400.
2nd, they make it VERY difficult to opt out of iFit by making it seem you can't use the treadmill until you unlock it by activating iFit which is BS. What they don't tell you is to press the iFit button for 15-30 seconds and it will disable. You have to call customer service or do research to find this little tidbit out.
That being said, it's a treadmill. Does squeak a lot when using it. The fact that it folds up brings nothing to the table unless you plan to put it in long-term storage. You're certainly not going to be moving it around after each use. Weighs 200+ pounds. Assembly is not complicated but will take an hour or two."
We bought this treadmill to replace one that required service twice a year each year for 3 years. This treadmill has been so easy to set up and use for both myself and my husband. We don't use ifit, we just select manual workout" and get exactly what we want from it. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this treadmill to anyone.
"Based on my experience setting this treadmill up and starting my first use, I think ethical people should read this review and strongly consider not buying from Nordic Track and its affiliated companies. Here's the story, in as few words as possible.
I let my teenage kids set this up from out of the box, with my guidance on one spot where they got stuck. But, when they tried to start the treadmill, they were required, by the directions and by the Nordic Track website, to sign up for some ""IFIT"" software program in order to actually turn the treadmill console on. They tried to do it several times, but I (their dad) wouldn't give them permission to use my information, and they came to a standstill.
I then tried what they had done to get the console started, to the same end. Nordic Track would not let the treadmill be used (the console is needed to run it) unless the treadmill was registered and I signed up for the IFIT software, along with my personal info and credit card info. I balked/rejected that option, and performed an online search on how to use the treadmill without doing what Nordic Track required. I found the workaround (I won't mention it here, because I detest having had to do that), and my family is now able to use the treadmill in the manual mode (only).
So, after I was done with the bypass step, I was able to very believably imagine an evil Nordic Track person-employee (who maybe doesn't even know they are evil) laughing about how hard it was for me to protect my family, particularly my kids, from Nordic Track using strong pressure tactics and disinformation to get extra money and personal info.
By the way, my kids all agreed that I should write this review."
"As other people stated, they try to force you into the iFit scam. Just hold down the iFit logo on the console for ~30 seconds to clear the locked screen so you don't have to give your credit card info and get scammed by the manufacturer.
I have only used it one day so I am not able to give an honest review of the functionality and longevity but it seems good so far.
The assembly is not near as bad as other people stated. It probably took me an hour and I wasn't in a big hurry.
My only reason for the one star review is them trying to trick customers into giving their credit card info when it's absolutely not necessary. I've seen other people complain on here how they waited hours on hold trying to either cancel the membership or find a way to use the treadmill without signing up for a membership. The fact that they try to scam you into signing up tells you something about their business practices and gives me concern regarding warranty issues that may arise. Let's hope I don't need to find out."
The treadmill has 3.0CHP motor which is barely minimum for running workout. But the Bluetooth is for audio only, cannot be used to synch with IPAD for better streaming experience. Either buy the T6.5S which is underpowered with 2.6CHP motor (with Bluetooth IPAD support) or the expensive T8.5 which has the larger 10" screen but is $700 more expensive. There are some liars out there that give wrong answers(yes) to my questions about use IPAD synch with this machine, as console. There is a tablet holder but is not at eye level, you have to keep head bend down to see it. Since you cannot pair IFIT on IPAD to this machine, it allows you to run the video without pairing, this is the workaround I am using. I run my IPAD and the 7 inch console program at the same time to give me a better view of the streaming scenery. I would not have made this choice, if their website information is not misleading.
"Purchased this treadmill about a week ago. assembling unit was a horror. for e.g. before put handle rails on their are four screws that'd to be removed. Whoever put together parts overtightened these four screws so much that we could not undo them. Lucky my exterminator was around and after working on screw for about five minutes he freed them. Calling nordic track is a joke. You hold on for 40 minutes snd then get disconnected while speaking to someone. They don't even call you back. The unit is working good right now, hopefully it will stand up well.
I have been in high profile sales for over fifty years, and if I gave service the wa they do, I would have been out of business in a short period of time,
H.B."
"I gave it a 4 star because I had to do a lot of adjusting of the belt to get it centered and also to get the tension between 2 and 3 inches. Also the belt squeaks when I walk on it. It is quiet when running without a load.
The assembly was easy but it takes me time to work on bolts that are close to the ground. I have trouble with my back so it took about 4 separate efforts to finish the bolts, not counting the final tightening required after assembling the display panel. If I were younger I would have done the job in about 45 mins including understanding the instructions.
Thanks to the reviewer who told me how to bypass the internet stuff. Pressing the Ifit button for 30 seconds did the job.
It will take a little time to get in shape. I have arthritic pain from walking so it will take a while for me to get a decent ""workout"". At the moment I am doing 13 minutes about 4x per day.
Folding and moving is not too hard. It is on a rug and that is where the resistance is made more difficult. If it were on a hard floor it would be a cinch.
The delivery guys were great. It was well worth it to pay an extra $20 to bring the unit down a flight of stairs."
"DEFECTED TREADMILL WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! DO NOT BUY!
Pros
1. The treadmill absorbs the impacts when running at 10 mph and does not shake the surrounding area.
Cons
1. Some of the manufactured parts were defected and would not align accordingly which made assembling difficult.
2. Activating iFit “ and the loophole to getting around it (courtesy of another Amazon Customer). After assembling your treadmill, turn on the treadmill, attach the key, then hold down the iFit logo on the treadmill for 30 seconds. This will skip the need to activate iFit and your treadmill should be working now.
3. NordicTrack Customer service experience was not helpful.
4. The incline/decline buttons would not work upon activating the treadmill. Treadmill was stuck at 0% incline grade upon activating the treadmill.
BREAKDOWN OF UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE:
2021.01.17 - Day 0 - Received and Assembled Treadmill.
2021.01.18 - Day 1 - Ran on the treadmill for the first 15 minutes with no problems at incline 0% and then the belt stopped moving. I figured to turn off the power and let it cool down for a couple of minutes and would attempt to run on it again. The belt would barely move and I had to drag my feet as if I was kick starting it. But the belt would just stop moving again. I continued this pattern for about 30 minutes and gave up.
2021.01.19 - Day 2 - I attempted to run again at incline 0% and the first 15 minutes was a success until the belt stopped moving again. I attempted the same method as Day 1 but to no prevail, so I decided to look at some reviews on Amazon.
Common concerns with the treadmill per Amazon Customer Reviews:
1. The control panel needed to be replaced and ordered through NordicTrack Customer Service which can take weeks to arrive (the control panel is a green computer hardware looking piece underneath the hood).
2. The motor was misaligned and needed to be adjusted.
3. The walking belt was not tensioned correctly (walking belt is the part that you actually run on).
All this requires the removal of the hood of the treadmill for examination (the hood is the part your toes point to while running and is attached by 5 screws).
2021.01.20. - Day 3 - I removed the hood to examine the motor and it's aligned. So I decided to run on the treadmill with the hood off to see if the belt stopped moving due to an overheating motor. To my theory, the treadmill worked perfectly for 40 minutes straight at incline 0% and different running speeds. Curious to see what NordicTrack Customer Service had to say, I decided to give them a call.
I explained how the treadmill belt would stop and the theory about the overheating motor to customer service and their response was for me to record the control panel the next time the belt stops moving and to call customer service back within their hours. The control panel will blink in a pattern of red/green/yellow/orange light which then will determine the issue. So I wasn't able to confirm the reason why the belt would stop moving 15 minutes into my run.
So I then brought up that my treadmill would not incline/decline and was stuck at 0% grade.
So customer service made me run through some diagnostics with them. I had to download an app called Visual Support which worked like FaceTime. Customer Service was able to see through my camera and walked through step by step with me and see how the treadmill was responding.
The first diagnostic was to open the hood and review the cables connected to the control panel. They verified that none of the cables were damaged and that the cables were plugged in all the way.
The second diagnostic was to review the red and green light that the control panel was emitting.
The third diagnostic was to test the tension of the walking belt and lift the walking belt about an inch high to ensure that the belt was not tight which would create friction and not rotate. No issues there.
Fourth diagnostic was to slide my hand underneath the walking belt and confirmed that it has been lubricated. No issues there.
The fifth diagnostic was to recalibrate my incline/decline function as I was not able to get it to work upon activation. The steps were:
1. Click on SETTINGS
2. Then the ^ (three buttons away from SETTINGS)
3. Then click on INCLINE ^
The treadmill will begin recalibration and start to incline to 10%. Then the treadmill is supposed to decline back to 0%. However, my treadmill was stuck at 10% and would not go back to 0% no matter what we try. Customer Service examined that the control panel was flickering red and green light but not reacting to the commands.
Customer service was shocked and confirmed that the control panel was faulty and not reading the commands of the display board. So they placed an order for a new control panel.
Customer Servicer stated that I will receive a confirmation email that an order for a control panel has been placed and is being processed. Then I will receive a separate email that confirms that the order has been shipped. Then I will need to replace the control panel myself by watching a YouTube tutorial.
2021.01.25 - Day 8 - the control panel order is still in processing and has yet to be shipped.
I am stuck with a treadmill that is inclined at 10% and cannot be lifted to create extra space.
I am on the verge of just contacting Amazon Customer Service to just return this faulty treadmill."
I've only had the treadmill for one day and as far as the product itself and its functionality goes, it seems fine so far. The biggest issue and reason for my 3-star rating is that the item description on Amazon was incorrect. The description incorrectly states that the speed is adjustable up to 12 mph, but in fact it only goes up to 10 mph. That may not be big deal for some but I was specifically looking for a treadmill with a max speed above 10 mph for those high intensity workouts. I'm in the process of returning it and replacing it with a different model (NordicTrack C990) which costs about $300 more. As I said, the product itself seems pretty good but just be aware that the true max speed is 10 mph not 12 mph.
Excellent addition to my home. I'm a fairly large wide-structured man, 6'2" 270 lbs, and I am able to run, jog, and walk without any issues or problems on the treadmill.
"Haven't used it yet I just put it together today. But I wanted to write a review about the assembly at least. It was a pain in the ass. I spent way too long on the grounding screw. Had to go to Home Depot and get one that actually fit and fit flush with the arm. So if you're wondering if you're doing something wrong, you're not. Don't question it. Just get another screw. You'll also need a ratchet set to tighten like 8 bolts.
I assembled everything myself. I'm 5'2 and it was a pain but possible. Once I use it I'll update this."
"I've had the treadmill (6.5 si) since April 23, 2020. It came a day early (pre-arranged with the delivery service), which was nice. I love it, don't regret buying it, and have used it every day.
What I didn't know is that you need 2 people to assemble the treadmill. If it stated that somewhere in the specifications before I purchased, I missed it. But, it is written on the first page of the manual, which you should read before assembling. You could probably use a third person to read the instructions while the other 2 assemble and bicker :) I consider myself pretty handy when it comes to putting stuff together but I made a few missteps. The whole thing took 3 hours to assemble (subtract a half an hour for the missteps, sometimes confusing instructions, and difficult screws).
It's very sturdy and bigger than I expected/wanted. It's very easy to fold and open but also requires 2 people to move it (also stated in the manual). I suggest that you assemble it where you plan to use it and don't plan on moving it too much or too far. And if you plan to put a mat under it make sure you assemble on the mat. The screen is a nice size. I got a 10-inch touch screen, which is big enough. No Bluetooth. Has an audio jack to connect other devices.
It came with a 1 free year subscription to IFit, which I like. Although I think that IFit could stand some improvements, like better organization of the classes by level but it could be that I haven't learned how to fully use the App. The subscription allows you to sign up four secondary users. You can use the treadmill manually as well, but I like that when you do an IFit class the machine automatically adjusts the incline and speed to the terrain in the class.
Update 1-10-21: I have no complaints about the treadmill. It's still working well and definitely worth the purchase. Additionally, over the last few weeks/months there have been some improvements to the IFit program. It is now Bluetooth compatible and you have access to contemporary music playing in the background. You can lower or turn off the music as well as the trainer's voice during the workouts, which was always an option."
This treadmill is probably overkill for us, but we wanted to make sure that it would last as we planned to use it. It has a large screen so that it is easy to see. Controlling the speed and incline is easy and can be done in two ways. It is comfortable to use and quiet while you are using it. You are also given several choices of pre-pepared scenes that will give you a choice in your workout.There are a few things that we are disappointed with though. This particular model does not allow you to set the time that you want for your use. It is not the end of the world, and you can clearly see the time and distance you have walked/run on the screen. The heart monitor leaves a lot to be desired. Perhaps we would have been better off had we bought the optional Bluetooth version that goes around the body. It is still an option for us, but our watches do keep an accurate account of our heartbeat. The other thing that needs to be included is a warning that the hex key, that comes with the treadmill, has different sized ends. While trying to adjust the track, I was unable to make the adjustment. It did not appear that the hex key was matched to the adjustment screw. It occurred to me later to look at the hex key to see what was wrong, and that is when i noticed that the two ends were different. I was using the wrong end of the key. Once I noticed that and used the right end, I had no problem making the proper adjustment.
I am completely satisfied with my NordicTrack T Series Treadmill. It is very substantial, making me feel perfectly comfortable walking or running. (I weigh around 195 lbs.) It was easy to assemble and easily fits in the smallest bedroom in our house. It makes a little bit more noise than I anticipated, but my family swears they can't hear a thing from other places in the house. It is extremely easy to program/use. There are short sidebars for steadying if you need that. I feel like I have more than enough room and almost never use the sidebars. There are 2 areas (pockets) for holding your water bottle, mobile phone, or whatnot. The emergency stop feature is there if you need extra assurance in the event of stumbling or falling. I especially like the incline feature; I sometimes want to be able to raise my heart rate without having to run, so I set the incline to 2-4% for additional intensity.
"We love it and we definitely love the iFit option ! You get the first year of iFit for free however you do have to sign up with iFit so they have your credit card info so that when the year is up it automatically renews ! I did the family plan which isn't cheap approximately $400.00 for my family members and I ( 4 people ) please look for the card in the box with the promotional code !!!! Without the code you cannot do the free year !!
So far we love it and would recommend this treadmill with iFit ! I would recommend picking the option where they put the treadmill in your room of choice for $20.00 !trust me it's worth it !
It was fairly easy to assemble ! You just have to take your time and take it slow .
The treadmill is very quiet !
I'm giving it 5 stars and the delivery with Amazon was seamless ! Also sign up for text messaging regarding delivery ... they let you know the exact time that the treadmill will be delivered!
If you have a smart TV you can connect the screen on the treadmill to your TV !
Enjoy !ðŸ’ª"
"This darn treadmill is changing my life! It's most incredible contraption. I can run in Venice, in Hawaii, in Australia, in Bend, Oregon guided by ifit trainers who are knowledgeable and motivating. I can even live stream if I want to. Who would ever think? The Ifit program synchs completely with the treadmill so I can go up hills and adjust speed to keep up with the trainers or go more slowly; however, I do wish that I'd paid a little more for the downhill option. My feet never get sore on this Nordic Track treadmill and it is so quiet. This should be mandatory equipment in every household. I am saving so much more in the medical bills I would be eventually incurring without this indoor, convenient option that keeps me moving in a positive direction. This Nordic Track is absolutely the best! I am positive they can't make them any better!
Another update:
Had this treadmill for several months now (during Covid) and it continues to be the most awesome, integral part of my survival. Being a cancer survivor, I find exercise the main component of my staying alive. I thank Nordic Track and Ifit (Tommy Rivers Puzey) for keeping me on track to health and fitness. I simply can't say enough about this machine. I know, it's a material possession...but it lends so very much more to life! This Nordic Track treadmill is everything and more than anyone can want."
Much nicer than my previous treadmill (Gold's Gym). Wide track, very powerful motor, easy to use features. Can adjust speed and incline from control panel. Reasons i did not give it a top score: instructions were not well written and clear, seems to squeak, raising track up and lowering seems awkward, and the main reason was the big push by Nordic track to use the online trainer to the cost associated with it. If i had not read the reviews online I would not know how to bypass the online feature. Also, what was point of putting a speaker in the unit if it sounds weak and terrible, drop that feature and write better instructions instead.
Delivered broken and belt will not move when turned on. Very disappointed - now I have to take my time to contact support for an almost $700 product. I will revise my review if issue is solved.
"Firstly, assembly is backbreaking work. I consider myself handier than the average person, solid with tools, etc. And this is not for amateurs. Save yourself a terrible evening and get a different product or a professional to assemble the product.
After about three hours, despite many parts not fitting into eachother (poor drill jobs in steel frame pilot holes), I finally assembled the product into a usable state, only to find that it was not positioned well and was lopsided. I'm an engineer so I took the frame of the base apart to diagnose the issue. The freaking factory never finished assembling three small pieces that are absolutely integral to the product's use. A 3/8"" Jam Nut, a 3/8"" Plastic Bushing, and a 3/8"" Washer were nowhere to be found.
The product is unusable. I'll get parts at home depot and attempt to salvage, but I'm awfully disappointed in such a poor product from an otherwise well known name.
Lastly, you can't even use the product until they push you through a clunky series of websites, links, and apps that coax you into purchasing their iFit monthly membership. You'll be so frustrated with your product setup you'll probably do it just to get to use the product, and I imagine most people probably will.
I expected a lot more out of NordicTrack, but I guess they've lost their quality over the years. Next time I'm going to spend the extra few hundred dollars with a competitor. Really kicking myself for not getting a Peloton at this point, would have been worth the headache.
My advice is try a different brand. Hope this is helpful."
We researched treadmills for weeks, then I read every negative review and almost didn't buy this treadmill, but my gut kept telling me this was the right one. It arrived securely boxed with no damage. We added expert assembly (initially thought we could do it ourselves but many of the negative reviews started with I assembled it EXACTLY like the instructions said, but..., so we decided to let a professional do it.). It was assembled in 2.5 hours when we were quoted 3-4 hours. The delivery company and the assembly company were very professional and organized, familiar with the equipment and knew exactly what they were doing. We opted out of iFit (when you first turn it on, just press and hold the iFit button down for 10-30 seconds and it'll jump to the home screen) and have used it several times since receiving it. It's on wheels but is still pretty heavy, so we set it up behind our couch. My family can sit in the living room and watch TV or a movie with me on the treadmill behind them. It's not any noisier than treadmills at a gym, so the TV volume just needs to be bumped up a smidge. I'll edit this review if anything goes wrong, but so far so great!
"I like this treadmill a lot--It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a treadmill in a professional gym but it doesn't cost as much either. I think for the price this treadmill is a great value--it feels solid, it has the electronic incline function (not manual), the speeds should cover most if not all home users (I run a lot and the speed settings of 5 - 7 are about as fast as I'd run outside).
I'm still considering the extended warranty since sh*t can happen, regardless of the extent of use and I'm sure it'd be expensive for parts and labor. I saw some negative reviews of the extended warranty saying that it doesn't cover the technician's trip to your home. Please read the fine print, below, taken from NordicTrack's site, and note that you'll be charged if you live > 25 miles from an authorized service center.
Overall: five starts, fits my needs and meets my high expectations for a well built, versatile treadmill.

"The treadmill itself works great. It is sturdy and much quieter than the one we had previously. The one hesitation I had buying this was the iFit trap they try and pull you into, but the recommendation on how to skip it worked for me: just hold down the iFit logo on the console and it will bypass it. Once bypassed it does not return.
For assembly, I was able to put it together alone just having my girlfriend hold pieces upright now and then. Just make sure you have your own tools, the ones they provide you are not adequate. Of particular note is that their screws are very shallow, so you may need to play around with different Phillips heads before you find one that works properly.
On a side note I had my delivery time with Amazon listed as between 12 pm and 3 pm on a Saturday but woke up to repeated phone calls and text messages at 7:15 am that morning because the delivery guys were outside. I am not going to have this reflected in the product rating because it was clearly a mix-up with the delivery company but I was not happy about it."
I am very pleased with my treadmill. I knew when I purchased it didn't have a lot of bells and whistles, and that's fine because I just need it to track my distance, press a button to incline, and work for running. It does everything I need it to. I assembled it by myself in a little over two hours, and the directions were very straightforward. I followed the tip about holding down the Ifit sync button to move past it. I didn't even want to deal with the hassle of cancelling it in a month so I didn't bother setting it up. It's not obnoxiously loud and I can hear my music and TV over it well. I recommend this treadmill for anyone wanting the basics and an affordable treadmill.
"My treadmill came undamaged and on time. It wasn't as difficult to put together as some of the reviews might have you believe. My adult son put it together in an hour - he did need help holding things a couple of times. Definitely a 2 person operation.
The treadmill works just fine. It doesn't have its own fan, as others do, but no biggie. It does have an option for IFit, but holding the button down for 30 seconds clears it off, and you can use the treadmill without it.
I will update this review if any problems come up but so far, it's great. Thanks!"
"I just received this treadmill yesterday. I've only run on it once. I have some pros and cons:
Pros:
It's very sturdy,
not super loud,
feels solid wile walking and running (I only got up to 5.4 MPH),
the display is a good size and easy to read.
Cons: I was VERY disappointed when I realized that while the ad says it is totally iFit compatible (but does clearly state that you have to buy a subscription), but it is only compatible when you buy a separate module for it (I got on an online chat with iFit and they told me the module is $180). I won't be doing that.
I'm also not happy with the ""settings"" feature. The settings are: Demo on or off, and English vs. Metric for distance - that's it. It seems there is no way to set your weight - so the calories burned feature is totally useless. I'd also like the ability to see Minutes per Mile instead of Miles per Hour, but there seems to be no way to change that either.
The free scheduled shipping was a bit of a disappointment as well. It did come exactly when they said it would, but this thing is a huge box that weighs almost 200 lbs. There was only one delivery man on the truck and it had to come it up a full flight of stairs. I was very lucky that my husband and another man were here at the time and it took all three of them to get it up the stairs. If they hadn't been here it would have been sitting on the porch. Even the paperwork that came with it said ""2 man delivery"".
I will update this review later if I find any ways to improve the settings feature.
My overall impression is that is a very sturdy basic treadmill. If you want to simply turn it on and walk and/or run and don't care about tracking anything other than your MPH, distance, and time on the machine; it's fine. I paid $599.99 plus tax (free shipping) so it's not a terrible value. I will say that I feel the ad description regarding the iFit is deceptive."
If I could give this bike zero stars I would. I would give it negative stars if possible. From day one, we had issues with product. When we ordered the product it let us pick the date to be delivered so we picked the following Saturday. Apparently this company doesn't deliver on Saturday (company outside of amazon) and they moved our date two weeks away. I called amazon and they told me to contact the shipping company which was AWFUL!! They changed the date on us again FOUR more times before receiving it. Once we did the box looked like it had been dropped and destroyed. Not to mention the two young men who brought it in looked 16 and dropped it twice bringing it in from the car. We get it and it takes 5 hours to set up. Everything works fine for a few weeks until I use the incline and it stops working. My fiancÃ© manages to get it fixed and it works for a few more weeks until I use the incline again. Now it's completely broken the screen won't turn on and NordicTrack says it's no longer under warranty even though I bought it in July and it's now November. I have been a runner my whole life and was trying to train for my first marathon. I will never buy another NordicTrack treadmill or exercise equipment from amazon again. This entire process was a headache and now I have a useless expensive treadmill in my house.
There is no customer support. I even purchased a $339.99 extended warranty and still have trouble getting help. I hate I even made this purchase, it turned out to be very stressful process.
Now that I have finally assembled the beast, so far it's great. It was delivered by truck, one man. The treadmill was on its side , then pushed off the truck so it landed on end. Handle with care was not in this guy's vocabulary. I'm 73 and have a bad back. I had to help him slide it onto my ground level porch. Really awkward and heavy. I drug it into my living room and unpacked it. Then I carried it into my family room with the help of my grandson. It was assembled fairly easy. I plugged it in, it didn't work. I registered it with Nordic track. Called, got help from a tech. She determined I needed a new main board. I waited eight days for the part to be delivered. I installed the board, put all back together, plugged it in and it didn't work. Called again and was guided through the analysis again. By the way you need a smart phone for that, that's so they can look at what I was seeing. This tech determined it was the power cable that runs through the leg. I waited another eight days for that to arrive. Again, didn't work. Called again, now the tech said it had to be the upper unit that contains the tablet. He ordered that, another eight days. The next day I was getting prepared to install that, so I unplugged the two connections for the electrical wiring from the upper unit to the base. I noticed that three wires were missing that come out of the cross handle where the unit measures your pulse. I called back, talked to tech, he looked and said whoops, it's not the upper unit, it's the part where the wiring comes from the key. He cancelled the upper part and fedexed the handle. This time I only had to wait 5 days. I got all back together and everything worked. Oh, the treadmill doesn't like my satellite internet so I now don't have iFit. Other than that it works just fine.
"**DO NOT BUY THIS**
This item is impossible to return even when it malfunctions or does not work as advertised. I am 280lbs and the tread mill stops when stepped on in lower speeds. After 15 miles of use in higher speedS the motor is much louder than it should be.
When I attempted to return the item that is not working, the Amazon selected freight company never showed. when called the stated they didn't have a route driver. The second attempt wouldn't pick it up because it wasn't returned in its packaging. Not sure who has room to keep a 5 foot box and tons of styrofoam laying around, but if I did it wouldn't have gone back into the package that was ripped during delivery.
Basically, the return process is designed to make you keep the item, please don't waste your money."
I've had this for about a month and I love it. It is sturdy. But it is a heavy piece of machinery so although it folds up and down very easily it wouldn't be easy to move it out of the way. So it stays put in my apartment which kinda defeats the folding but hey, it's there if I must move it. This is my third treadmill from Amazon and I'm keeping this one. To be fair this one is twice the price of the other two that I have returned. So if you can afford it pay the double amount and don't deal with putting them together and then deal with disassembling and sending back. This was easy to put together but you need two people and follow the instructions step by step. I'm also very greatful to the person who put in the review for not turning ifit on by depressing the button before first use. It really takes care of dealing with cancelling it later.
"After having a neighbor help me move it downstairs and around two tight corners, it took me about 4 hours to assemble. Were I to do another one, could probably do it in two hours. Pretty much a one person job, though there are a few steps where an extra set of hands are useful for short periods. I'm a bit unhappy that some of the fasteners were missing and one of the hand holder bolts simply would not install (not sure if the hole was stripped or the bolt made poorly). I'll make do with three of four holders since they're pretty large bolts, and I was able to scrounge up the other missing fasteners in my garage. The instructions could have been a bit clearer, but they were workable however time consuming it was to figure things out. I opted for the 7"" screen; it's a bit small, but workable for iFit and I've got a large TV mounted on the wall (wish I could throw the 7"" to the big TV, but there's no HDMI port on the 7.5 as there is on some of the more expensive models). Considering that I purchased this at a huge discount during a sale, I'm quite pleased with it. EDIT 3/17: Now that I've put a few days of workouts on my treadmill, I like it even more. Maybe my favorite part is the iFit Google Map application. I live in a hilly part of town and now can walk those hills without fear of getting run over. Amazing how the incline adapts as I climb....hit a flat area....then climb again. You also get more or less a slide show as you walk, based on Google maps tracking. Yes, it may be dated, but there are plenty of recognizable landmarks. I've also tried a few of the iFit routines and they're pretty good and interesting as well. I'd probably opt for the individual subscription after a year since my spouse is more of an elliptical user.
Update 5/5/2020: Loving this treadmill more and more everyday. It's a 5 star as far as performance goes. During the Covid isolation, I enjoy that I can go for a run on Easter Island with a trainer, or simply devise my own routes wherever Google maps exists; today, London tomorrow the rest of the world. Very cool. BTW, my wife doesn't use her elliptical much anymore once she got on this treadmill.
Update 5/21/20: Raised this to 5 stars. The benefits far outweigh the almost forgotten installation process. Now if only it had a decline mode, but that would make it cost twice as much, so I guess I'll have to get used to running the downhills on Google Maps at 0% elevation instead of an actual decline. Since this was first installed in early March, I've dropped 28 pounds (obviously by incorporating exercise with better eating habits) and my resting heart rate has gone from 82bpm to 67bpm thus making my heart a lot happier. Additionally, have reduced my 400 meter time by more than 30 seconds. This really isn't about bragging as extolling the benefits of having this machine in my life.
Update 11/24/2020: I've dropped two stars from my review. The treadmill is horribly out of calibration and has been since I received it. How would one know? In my case, I bought a Garmin Forerunner for outdoor workouts. Lucky me, my treadmill was calibrated in a manner that I was running and working much harder than it indicated. So now when I'm training for a 5K with a 27:00 goal (hey, I'm over 70 so don't laugh), I've learned to use training methods for 27:00 outside and 29:00 on the Nordic Track. That's a HUGE difference, but it works, so its telling me that it's around 7% out of calibration. The big problem is that the NT website states: Many recent models, including all models with touchscreen consoles, do not have the capability for the user to calibrate the speed"". Well, what the heck sort of lousy engineering and lousy build is that? It's difficult to get through to a CSR, but when I do I expect to hear the same answer I read on their website. Too bad. Guess I'll have to to use my mathematical skills every time now as I reach different goals. Unfortunately, they have some great races on ZWIFT which I'll never get to credibly compete in since my treadmill is so out of whack and Zwift uses the treadmill distance indicator."
"Not a bad treadmill. The only issue I have is the squeaking noise while walking. When the last tech service came to my house to move from one room to another. I mentioned it to him. He said add oil, I said where? where it squeaks. But this is brand new machine, had not been use because of the location. He just left without solving the issue.
The squeak is totally annoying!!
I have a question, with the new technology these days, how can you connect you phone to the machine to hear the music through the speakers without signing up for ifit? there is no UBS port but a pinhole. Current smart phone use USB Ports."
"This treadmill is not a good choice. Hard to assemble. The advertisement of free assembly by an expert seems to be a scam. They tell you your order will arrive in 5-7 days, but that only includes the assembly service and not the treadmill. If there is nothing to assemble at your address how can they assembly the treadmill? The treadmill takes about 15 days to arrive. My first review was denied because I didn't follow ""guidelines"". I have a feeling a lot for the reviews for this product ate denied making it look better than it is in reality. If this review is denied I'll just write another and another until it's posted. Because I had to write this again the review went from 2 stars to 1. Dishonest service and advertising for this product. Do not buy.
On top of all that after you have it assembled you are forced to sign up for a trial session of ifit, the fitnesss workout program that comes with the treadmill. There is zero mention of this when you purchase the product. I find this highly misleading as well.
Dishonest, shady, just not good all around."
Last August, I bought a NordicTrack treadmill at Amazon. Two months later, it stopped working. I am asking the company for help; they are not finding the solution to the issue, after two hours of waiting for the phone to talk with a representative. I asked them to exchange the machine, and they answered that they could not exchange it because I bought it from Amazon. This situation is making me anxious and very upset. I am feeling disrespected as someone stilled me.
So I've had this treadmill for about a month now. I did so much research on treadmills and read so many reviews. The biggest issue I read was people hated the iFit that comes with the Nordertrack. I can honestly say it is my favorite thing about using this treadmill. It motivates me so much more than I realized. Love love love this machine.
"For me the unboxing and assembly took some time. In fact I still don't have the bar underneath the treadmill so you can fold it upright connected. First off I'm only 5-3 120 and I was able to get the Treadmill from the garage to the basement family room by myself. A don't do this at home idea. As far as the assembly it was a little more difficult compared with other complex assemblys. The parts were all there. That was nice. All you need is a wrench, and phillips screwdriver. There are very few parts. I normally have tons more screws when assembling another product. The manual is clear enough. I wish the holes in a couple of important parts were a tiny bit larger. However, I switched to my own screws and then came back and used there's. In other words it takes a lot of force for there's to go through the steel. A power drill might work better than screwdriver. I had a confusing part with the dashboard cable caught in the bolt hole area and called customer support. They took had me take a photo and she was able to determine how the cord was misplaced. Excellent support help that I might not have figured out.
I don't see what everybody is complaing about this ifit problem. My theory is take the one month free and see what the maximum features are and if you want to eliminate the monthly charge just cancel and it runs great without ifit. The features on ifit are fun and I love the way the coachs control the incline and speed according to your exercise. You do have the ability to override the features.
The product is typical Nordictrack quality. A very nice treadmill to run on. Its big, comfortable, runs quiet, variable incline and speed measurements at 1/10 intervals. Plenty of room on the sides so if you want to hop off and keep the trainer going while you rest is nice. The bluetooth connect to the ifit works great. With an ipad it works nice. You can realign the belt which I didn't need to use. I haven't tried the ipod speaker idea. There are speakers but haven't had a chance to use them. I like the display with many different features to so and emphasise in front of you. Nice pulse tracker if you like. Being able to just hold onto the crossbar and measure how much effort you are putting into the exercise. Nice easy to read display and I have the smallest one. That is plenty large for me. Again I watch the videos on my ipad which sits nicely on the display.
Overall, I wasn't happy during the assembly. Always complaing but that seems to be the norm when its a difficult assembly. Once I had it together I really like this machine. Its heavy, sturdy and made to last. Haven't had it for long but for the price its a top of the line model and glad I didn't go with a lesser known brand. I would recommend.
The free one month Ifit just isn't all that bad and you can bypass that idea but I didn't consider that idea."
"I wish I could comment on how this treadmill actually works but after 3 months I still DO NOT KNOW! I ordered this treadmill in October 2020. It took a month to receive the treadmill. I put it together immediately to discover it doesn't work. I contacted NordicTrack that same day I put it together and they determined there is a short in the console. They ordered me a new console. However after 2 months I am still waiting for said console. I have contacted NordicTrack numerous times to only be told it would take 2-3 weeks, however after 8 weeks I'm still waiting. After the 4th time of contacting them I finally got answers saying the part is back ordered. No one at NordicTrack seems to care that I've had an inoperable treadmill for months. I normally wouldn't write such a review but I was recently contacted by NordicTrack to write a review in which they stated ""We value customer feedback and are willing to send either a floor mat or maintenance kit as a thank you for posting a review!""
So here is my customer feedback...do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS TREADMILL or any treadmill from NordicTrack unless you want terrible customer service from a company that clearly does not care about you after you have bought their product. I imagine any glowing review of NordicTrack it because someone received a free good. Poor business tactic."
Absolutely love this treadmill not a bunch to assemble took my husband about 20 minutes to set up and we used it right away with no problems. The quality is exceptional. Came really fast even during quarantine. Happy customer. No fan but it's still a great product
"I've had many treadmills, from bargain basement price to thousands of dollars: none of them lasted past 2 years without a ton of hassle. I've given up on finding the perfect model and now I aim for the middle: a treadmill with decent basics that I can walk and do light jogging on, with some extras but not all the complex bells and whistles I never seem to use. This one fits the bill for my minimum standards.
HOWEVER: the assembly of this thing was awful, unnecessarily so because of poor quality control alone. Screw-holes not properly threaded so screws won't fit. You get exactly the number of parts needed, no spares, so don't accidentally drop a screw or washer where you can't find it. The neoprene sleeves on the handbars were cut unevenly and misaligned, I had to trim them down to get the crosspiece mounted. In addition to the paper instructions, you can download the BILT app which provides step-by-step 3D assembly. If everything had been properly machined and tooled, this install would probably have taken 30 minutes with minimal effort. As it stands with all the problems and crappy quality, I spread it out over days since I had to buy other screws and recover from the aggravation.
I'm not using the speakers/stereo functionality of the console (you'll need to manually plug in your device if you want that, very throwback). Display gives you the typical options. Incline works smoothly and you can adjust the shock absorber things under the track if you prefer a firmer or bouncier run. Folding up and down is simple. The console and other parts are mostly plastic and feel pretty cheap. There are wheels on the rear legs to assist in moving but they are pretty tiny: no matter how you tilt, the metal legs are still close to the ground and I tore a piece of my treadmill mat that way. Overall, a decent treadmill and (probably) worth the six hundred or so I paid, if it lasts 2 years.
IMPORTANT: don't get roped into the Free Trial for iFit unless you know you want to subscribe long term. Just hold down the iFit button on the console for about 30 seconds and it will activate the treadmill for use without you having to sign up for anything."
I have never written a bad review until now. Bought treadmill and paid to have it assembled. 5 weeks later it stopped working, on Thanksgiving! No one was available to talk to until the following Monday (off for holiday and they don't work weekends in service department). Said they needed to order a part but it was on back order with NO ETA. Continued checking back regularly and finally was told it would arrive by the end of December. It is now Jan 23 and no part. I've called several times over the past few weeks, sat on hold for an hour before hanging up, being disconnected, or told to call back because they were training employees and not taking calls. Today, I was on hold for over an hour but finally got to talk to someone! Same news as last time- part should be in within the next 1-2 weeks and then they will ship it to me. I'm not holding my breath. I loved the machine for the month that it worked.
"I received my treadmill about two and a half weeks ago and hired a professional technician to assemble it. It took several hours to complete the assembly. When we finally turned on the unit, a huge tear in the belt (hidden throughout the assembly process) rotated into view. I registered the product and requested service to replace the torn belt under warranty. That was two weeks ago, and the company has made no effort to contact me or correct the problem.
This is a brand new 300 lb treadmill that I ordered weeks ago and had professionally assembled. I do not want to return it and start all over again when all that is needed is a new belt. However, NordicTrack is leaving me with no choice with their abysmal customer service. What a huge disappointment.
My advice is to stay away from this company until they improve on their commitment to customer service and to correcting issues with brand new units.
Update 9/18: I received no response from the three online service requests I submitted to NordicTrack over the course of three weeks. I finally steeled myself to an endless wait time and called their customer service number. The rep offered to send a belt but expected me to perform my own repair - for a brand new product under warranty. I'm not handy, and have no interest in doing treadmill repair.
I arranged for a partial return with Amazon, who discounted the product sufficiently to cover the new belt and technician. I sure hope this machine never breaks, because NordicTrack won't provide any support.
Amazon handled my problem very effectively."
"This treadmill has so many issues I'm not sure I can keep it.
1. I was able to put it together myself, even though the instructions indicate you need 2. I don't have someone that would come over with the COVID stuff going on. I used bungee cord and these straps that you use to move heavy furniture, as my 2nd hands.
2. There are a few problems when putting it together.
3. The first, the instructions state to use a screw driver and an adjustable wrench. It was impossible to tighten the bottom screws for the legs to the main body with a wrench. I ended up using a 9/16 ratchet to tighten. The wrench wouldn't even fit where the screws were located (image #1).
4. The other issue, the instructions say (p. 12 & 13) ""push the upright wire into the right upright leg"" but that doesn't work. The problem is the wire from the console doesn't fit the space that's left available between the leg and the arm. So I had to tuck the wire under the console (image #2).
5. The other issue with the console wire, you can't screw in the right side compartment holder because the wires are in the way of the hole (image #3).
6. The leg cover doesn't cover the cords that are left out at the bottom of the right leg so I'll have to cut a space in the cover to allow room for the grounding wire (image #4) and the other wire (image #5). Maybe I installed the wire wrong but I don't see another way to attach the wire to the grounding screw from the inside.
7. I was excited to use it but first I had to get around the IFIT registration requirement. Everything in the paperwork suggests that you have to register the device with IFIT to use it. First, IFIT requires a credit card to set up, even though they say the first 30 days are free. That seems deceptive to me so I called customer service and they said to push the IFIT button for 30 sections to enter manual mode which will bypass the IFIT registration.
8. The motor is soooo loud. It sounds like a dead engine trying to make it up a hill, this combined with the sound of your shoes on the belt is very distracting.
I'll have to try it for a few days, but honestly, the other treadmills are outside my budget."
"Let me start by saying you can bypass the iFit registration. That is NOT necessary to use this treadmill. Press the blue iFit button on the display and hold until it flashes and beeps. Then you can use the manual or the manufacturer built-in workouts.
I assembled the treadmill by myself, but yes, having a second person to help hold is nice (I'm sure ha ha!). The instructions are super easy to follow, and the best advice I could give you is lay out all the parts and separate the packaging right from the get go. Keep your work area tidy and put your tools back in one location before you start the next step. Took me about 1 hour to do alone.
The treadmill is great for what I need and was looking for. It's very sturdy and is fairly quiet (I find running is actually quieter than walking). It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, and it allows me to control my workout.
A few words to the wise: when you hit stop from running or walking, it stops, like almost immediately. It doesn't have a slow down, so just be ready for that or put your legs on the sides before you hit stop. Also, when you stop the workout and have the incline up, you have to push the button to lower the incline before you shut it down. Do not forget to put the incline to 0 before folding up for storage. I also read a lot of reviews that said the customer service was terrible, so I did get the protection plan as well when I purchased and registered it with the company. I also read all the other companies had terrible customer care, so I figured it's all the same, and hope I never need to call them.
So if you're looking for a great quality treadmill thats simple to use for your daily run, walk, workout routine, go no further."
Great treadmill for the price. I almost cancelled my order when I read the bad reviews. Do not read the bad reviews they are not all correct I didn't read all but whatever I read scared the hell of me. First of all do not assemble it yourself. I don't care how handy you are unless u assemble treadmill on a regular basis. I hired an company they did great job everything works as stated. Heart monitor is exact. One of the reviews mentioned that heart rate is false it's not. I wear an Apple Watch and heart rate is same as what Apple Watch displays. Yes it came with a plastic part broken during delivery but it's just cosmetic it doesn't affect the running or walking factor. Bottom part and motor cover were broken but called manufacturer and they are sending the parts and schedule a tech to replace them. Amazon was great to give me an extra discount because of that as long as it's safe. Incline is correct I know because I belong to a gym I know how incline works. I think most of the reviews are from people who tried to assemble the machine themselves . True some said machine came with manufacturers defect but you always can call Nordictrack and get help. I love this treadmill especially my gym is closed now.
"As for the treadmill, it seems well constructed, was very easy to assemble and has made my wife pretty happy - win. You can press and hold the iFit button down for approx 20 seconds and bypass the monthly reoccurring membership to work out if you want - thanks to whoever posted that in their review earlier as I clearly do not want to pay a monthly gym membership at home.
As for buying large objects like this through Amazon - think it out and set your expectations. I have found Amazon to be completely reliable for printer ink, woodworking hand held tools and equipment, cleaning supplies... coffee... BUT I have not had good luck buying larger freight shipment items. This was scheduled for delivery on July 23rd and we received it on August 6th. We paid for the deliver to room of choice - XPO the subcontracted delivery from Amazon almost left the box on our curb but we heard the truck and went out and after a short discussion they agreed to bring it 200+' up our driveway and roll to our back patio where I assembled it. XPO was absolutely awful. I had to call Amazon to get in touch with them and they are a freight service - not a customer service type business. They could give a hoot what you think, feel, or want... they'll deliver it to you when they are darn good and ready. From the package tracker we saw that the treadmill arrived in our city on the 24th of July. Amazon said we needed to wait until the 6th of August before they would refund or reorder and viola, on the 6th of August in the afternoon it arrived. The box had significant damage. The packaging inside the box was rumbled. The upright rails were scratched and one of the side plates on the belt assembly has a cosmetic dent in it. I say all of this to help you temper your expectations. Prime meant free delivery but ... you might want to pay a local retailer to deliver your machine.
As for the treadmill as a whole. This is a very basic model which is exactly what we wanted. If you're looking for a fancy full of features and video deal you'll need to spend some more. As for us, we'll watch TV or listen to our Bose sound and really just want the workout."
Bought this treadmill 2 months ago and am surprised how often I've been using it. It is quite heavy but was easy to set up. It takes up remarkably little room when folded up. It seems to be well made and no, you don't need iFit membership to use the machine. Set up my iPad on the tray and listen to audio books or music during my run. Highly recommend the treadmill.
"GREAT treadmill. Especially for the price. Yes, the iFit button hack is one of the main reasons this is a five star and not a three star, but w/e. Can't knock a company for trying to come up with extra monthly income. Let's talk about the machine itself.
First off: definitely try to get the delivery people to deliver this as close to the room you want as possible. Especially if you live alone. I didn't think 200+ lbs was that big of a deal when I saw it in the description, but trust me...it is a chore lugging up and down stairs. Thank God for delivery folk.
Next: just putting this together can be daunting if you don't have another person. The first couple of steps are manageable by yourself. Putting the handrails together, getting the wire through etc...it's annoying, but definitely simple and straightforward. HOWEVER: at the end...when you are trying to get the hydraulic lift pole thingy in place by holding up the 200 lb machine and unscrewing then screwing in bolts...yeah. That can be a real b-word if you are trying to do it yourself. I highly recommend having a friend or husband or large dog or something holding the machine up while you work it lest you have it just fall on you and kill you.
Running on this thing has been pure joy. Thanks to COVID, we're all trying to avoid icky germs and being around other people. Hence gyms = nono. I found this machine as good as any that I have used at most of the gyms I've been to, though it is without some bells and whistles and it is only ever going to be as sturdy as you make it since...well..you are putting it together.
It's a good buy. Worth the price for sure. Just remember what I tell you."
"First and foremost, I had quite an issue in the beginning. Like many of you, my treadmill came broken. Initially, I didn't mind it at all, I just called customer service and said that I don't mind keeping it but I am not willing to pay for the full amount only because it's not brand new, it's broken. They honored that and I was happy. However, as my boyfriend and I were building this thing, *note i highly recommend at least two people* we realized that there are missing pieces. So then I call amazon again, after a hour of being transferred like three times, I was able to get a brand new treadmill for the same discounted price. Especially since it took HOURS to put this thing together.
Like others as well, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR IFIT! Press the blue button for about 30 seconds and it'll turn on. Don't get scammed into the credit card scheme. I'm sure it's great and all but I don't like things being forced on me.
Now in regards of the treadmill, it's pretty nice! Granted it took forever to build. Assembly directions are garbage. Google or youtube it, because there's a step at the end that you need to do actually in the beginning. It's like the wire covering sliders that goes over the wires on the sides. You need to do that like in the beginning stages, youtube it you'll see what i mean. The directions are written poorly. The screws sometimes don't even fit, you'll see what im talking about. We used a hammer etc.
The treadmill after it was put together, it was great! I did my workout a few times, it's a bit loud but that's normal in my opinion. It's like as loud as going to the gym and using one of their treadmills. The speakers are a nice touch, ipod is a bit outdated lol. Overall, without the ifit program, it still inclines up to level 10, speed goes up to 10, measures your pulse by the grip, time, calories, and distance. The important stuff, i hope this review helps.
Ps. yes the exchange was annoying but it was worth it for me because i'm not paying 900 something (protection plan included) for something broken. Cheers!"
Got the product, and the plastic frame around the belt was broken. I will update my review once I receive the new one in (hopefully) new condition.
"First let me start by saying the treadmill is amazing. One of the delivery guys was bringing it in and their first comment was man this is heavy you can tell this isn't a cheap one. It's incredibly sturdy and everything works as desired without unnecessary frills. I've been on treadmills with fans before they don't do anything :) The delivery guys were fast and polite.
Now the negative which has nothing to do with Amazon or the treadmill itself, but the deceptiveness and out right lies that are printed inside of the manuals and the screen when you purchased this treadmill claiming that it literally will not work if you don't activate the iFit subscription. This is not unique to just this treadmill, it is the new wave sweeping exercise equipment. They will outright claim that you have to subscribe to their subscriptions or equipment will not work and it is not true. To be honest I'm really surprised this is legal.
However....The 30 second trick does work! Hold down the blue iFit button for 30 seconds and it will get you out of the screen telling you to activate ifit and your treadmill will immediately start working!!
At the end of the day I would recommend this treadmill and hope that lawmakers stop this immoral practice praying on people who fall for their lies."
This is an awesome treadmill! I'm 200 pounds and I can run on it just fine. IFit is predatory and annoying, but I knew from other reviews to override it and never give my credit card information (it works great without it). The programs and incline are great, and I haven't had any issues so far. It is a bit noisy but if you shut the door it isn't that noticeable. It is heavy to carry up the stairs, so make sure you put it where you want it to stay. Some of the reviews said it was hard to lift it to fold up, but I don't think it's heavy (I'm an out of shape 200 pound woman). It took my husband a few hours to put together. The cup holders are super huge which I love because I can fit a large mason jar of water in them. Thanks!
"So far I love it. It's the perfect price. Some people don't want to get this because it says you have to subscribe to the iFit program. I never had to! I learned that if you hold the iFit button for about 20-30 sec it skip the whole having to sign up to it. Doing that I didn't have to worry about having to call to cancel the subscription. It comes with 4 programs that have 5 different levels in each-20 in total! They are not all that easy I have to stop on one about 15 min into it because I couldn't keep up! I know I'm not that in shape but I'm not that out of shape either. I'm 5'7'' 125 lbs and have had 4 kids. The hear rate monitor works- at first I thought it didn't because it would start to blink like it was going to give me my results and then it would disappear. I learned that even if it did that you have to keep your hands there and your heart rate WILL appear-you just have to be patient.
The incline works great! Haven't had a problem. Same with the speed.
Unless you know for a fact that you can run/sprint more than 10 mph then you can consider getting a faster treadmill. I could barely keep up going 6 mph for a little bit. Cup holders are great. It does have a plug for an auxiliary cable if you want to use your phone with its speakers. The side rails(not sure if thats what they're called) help when I lose my balance to get back on track. It also has the emergency stop that you can clip on to yourself in case you fall.
It won't fit through all door frames so measure! It helps if you know what room your going to want it in so it gets assembled in that one room. It not too noisy- I don't think I've ever used a treadmill that was dead silent before. It doesn't have a fan but even the ones that do are not even that strong! I think the treadmills that have them are just to make it feel more like your outside rather than to cool you off. Just grab a fan you already have at home and done! Overall I believe I made a great purchase!"
Great little treadmill. I did a bunch of research prior to purchasing this one as I didn't want to spend a ton of money but I also wanted to be able to run on my treadmill and not have it fall apart. This one works great and I also double as using it as walking desk as I work from home and the straight handlebars work perfectly to rest a piece of wood on. I used an old shelf and attached some webbing to the back so that it doesn't slide off and it doesn't move at all at level 4 which is about the fastest pace I can walk before running. I then got a wireless keyboard and it works awesome! Great way to get exercise but also work at the same time :)
Figured after three years of use with usually anywhere form 4-5 30+ minute workouts weekly it's worth the review. Works great still! Love this little treadmill. Helped me lose 40 pounds and keep it off. I prefer working out at home rather than the gym and this is a great little machine to do that with. Definitely recommend!!
"I actually like this treadmill, despite the negative reviews. It sits folded up in our living room and is easy to pull out every night when I go for my run; I just fold the carpet back and pull it forward. I've had it a few months now, and I use it just about every night.
This treadmill is a good compact size that fits my body, living space, and workout requirements. For reference, I'm 5'7 with a stride of about a yard, and I weigh 200lbs. I typically jog on it at about 5 to 6mph for 20 to 30 minutes. Jogging and power walking are more ideal for this treadmill than just walking because the arms are quite close and the perfect height to whack your hand if you don't keep your arms bent or close to you.
Keep in mind, this is a treadmill and you're running. While the motor isn't too terribly loud, the frame is hollow metal and plastic, so every footfall is going to make some noise. Not that the treadmill feels unstable, quite the contrary. However watching a TV show may be a bit difficult for the runner without closed captions turned on. Headphones are also an effective solution. The noise doesn't bother my husband if I'm jogging while we're watching a TV show, though, so yes, it is just you.
Setting this up out of the box was relatively straightforward, and it comes with some silicone lubricant for the belt. You will want to order more so you can keep up maintenance. The treadmill is cheap, but it will last you longer if you take good care of it.
All in all, this is exactly what I wanted in exactly the price range I wanted. If you're looking for a treadmill like at the gym with every button under the sun, adjustable inclines, etc, this is most definitely not the treadmill for you. If you're looking for a compact workout machine to keep you moving that doesn't take up too much space in your life or home, this is a decent option."
I think part of the advantage a lot of treadmill companies have is most people only use their product for a few months until it becomes a coat hanger. Unfortunately, I actually use mine and it has already stopped working in less than 6 months. I ONLY walk on this at a 2 speed and it is already broken. If you are looking for an expensive hanger this is perfect. If you want a treadmill for long term use spend a few extra bucks and buy a better one. Expensive lesson for me....
"I have been using the treadmill for about 2 weeks now. I don't run, but I've been walking 2mph or less for 30 minutes at a time. In the last week, the belt has started to shift to the right or left and rubbing on the sides which makes the belt jerky. In the instructions it explained how to adjust the belt, and I had done that. Now it seems I need to adjust it daily, and on several days I've had to get off several times during the walking session to adjust it. (Maybe I'm doing it wrong?? I doubt it.)
Although it is irritating to constantly readjust it, I can use the machine for my purposes. If I was an avid runner, I would be hesitant to continue to use this machine.
Update after 1 month. The treadmill is increasingly getting more jerky. If I had an opportunity to rebuy a treadmill, I would not buy this one."
"For the price, I wasnt expecting a high quality treadmill but I was hoping that it would work. In addition to being completely worthless, this purchase is a total time and energy suck.
1. Turns on but does not run
2. Safety magnet was clearly made for another model because it's not at all compatible with this machine. And it's required for the belt to run.
3. Machine is cracked in several places
4. Assembly and operating instructions in Spanish only (I cant read Spanish). AND FOR A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TREADMILL.
5. Huge waste of my time and energy"
"I'm a 78 year old man in good health, weighing 153 pounds and standing about 5' 9"". The boxed Sunny Health & Fitness Treadmill arrived in my garage. I removed the top of the box in the garage, leaving the treadmill (a single connected assembly) lying in the bottom half of the box, well restrained by styrofoam blocks and partially enclosed in plastic. My son and I ""carried"" this 120 pound load upstairs to the bedroom, lifted the treadmill from the box, and placed it on the wood floor. After that, it was only necessary to raise the upright part of the treadmill and use the supplied Allen wrench to screw in 10 bolts (with included lock washers.... no nuts) in easily located places according to the instruction booklet. The bolt holes were readily accessible. The most difficult thing to do was to apply the supplied light grease under the nylon (?) belt. Very difficult getting the hand under the belt to spread the grease over the smooth metal surface upon which the belt runs. Perhaps I should have loosened the belt by turning the two adjustment screws at the back before applying the grease.
After about 10 days, the treadmill is now like a friend. It rests next to the bed and beckons every time I enter the bedroom. It is very well constructed, is sturdy, and has an attractive appearance. Its utility is excellent..... very easy to operate. The 0.1 mph speed adjustment intervals are just what the doctor ordered. I would not consider a treadmill with a coarser speed adjustment interval.
I probably won't run on the treadmill, so I can only comment about how it performs for a walker. My walk will probably not often exceed a speed of 2 mph (but maybe it will in time). So far my walks (about 0.3 miles in 10 minutes) have been a pleasure. As I walk I adjust the speed as it seems fitting. There are up/down speed-adjustment buttons on the right handle, making it very easy to vary the speed as you walk. There are on/off buttons on the left handle. Also, there are certain select speed buttons on the console as well as variable-speed-program buttons. The console displays your lapsed time (nearest second), speed (nearest 0.1 mph), distance traveled (nearest 0.01 miles), and calories burned (nearest 0.1 calorie). If you grip the handles at particular places, the console also displays your pulse rate (beats per second). There is little cushioning (a nylon belt running on a greased metal surface), but I find that to be no problem ... my walking shoes supply all the cushioning necessary.
The treadmill arrives with the incline set at its highest value. I didn't adjust that, but I placed small pieces of carpet under the rear ""feet"" to make sure that the floor would not be marred (the treadmill's front feet are rubber). So, I walk at an incline a little less than the maximum. The treadmill does not move significantly (haven't noticed any movement) on the floor, there being no motor vibration. The motor is quiet at the speeds I've used. Most of the sound (not much) is produced by the nylon belt on the greased metal surface.
I heartily recommend this treadmill to anyone who will use it for walking. And, as far as I know, it will perform well for runners too."
When I received the treadmill in the mail some of the plastic was cracked near handles which I was willing to over look. I had this product for little over a week and the motor already started to go bad. I contacted sunny fitness and after a few proof purchase pictures and a video they are sending me new motor. Very fast customer service which is good. But let it be noted that the structure has a three year warranty but the parts only have a 90 day warranty from day of purchase. I find this extremely disappointing... So guess it's good motor broke early
"I don't understand where all the negative feedback is coming from. This is a nice little treadmill, and I doubt you could find a comparable one within the same price range. Maybe I got lucky? Because mine had a perfectly aligned belt, none of the parts were cracked or anything like that. It arrived in pristine condition. Setting it up was fairly easy, as long as you spend a couple of minutes to READ THE MANUAL!!! I bet you some of the 1-star reviews were by non-manual readers!
I also bought a tread lubrication kit and applied it PRIOR TO FIRST USE. This is because I wanted to make sure my treadmill is running in optimal condition. I've already had several running sessions-- what a great workout! Warmup at 2 MPH, brisk jog at 4 MPH, then some high intensity intervals at 6 MPH. Gets your heart pumping. My boys love walking on it (under supervision, of course), the only rule is they don't go over 2 MPH! They aren't old enough for a brisk jog.
That said, I've had this treadmill for only about a week, and from what I've seen, it looks like it will give me a lot of running enjoyment. If anything comes up, I will update this review. Just make sure to lubricate the tread once a month, and keep the belt aligned. If you take care of your treadmill, it will take care of you!"
Easy to assembled. I received this treadmill on September 2020. When I opened the box everything's good. Maybe don't listen to bad reviews. Mine was perfect and please read the manual before start using the treadmill. I will update again in few months.
After a ton of research I purchased this treadmill in 2015. I am a long distance runner on a small budget. The price tag and the reviews were great so I decided to go for it. The manual incline is what it is but otherwise this treadmill is rock solid. I have owned this treadmill for 5 years now and have logged thousands of miles on it. I have trained for multiple half marathons, 4 full marathons, and an ultra marathon with the help of this machine. It's rugged, the shock absorption is great, can handle challenging speed workouts, has great tablet/phone/water bottle holders, and is easy to fold/unfold and move. I am thoroughly impressed and quite honestly really proud of this treadmill! We have spent a lot of quality time together. The only maintenance I do is to clean and lubricate the belt every few months.
"I really wanted to write a good review but not the case. After 3 1/2 months this treadmill completely stopped working. I contacted Sunny Health support & after diagnosing over the phone, I was sent a motor, motherboard & connector box to replace on my own with a you tube video for help. Long story short, replaced parts & machine malfunctioned again a week later. I called again, was told it needed calibrating after it nearly sent me flying off the end of the belt. I was sent a video. Didn't work & once again I was almost injured when trying to calibrate. Called support again, spoke with Bryan & while on the phone with Bryan the motor started sparking. I immediately turned the machine off & unplugged it in fear of burning down my house! Bryan informed me he had to speak to the manufacturer. Two phone calls to Bryan later & all I get is he will call you back which he has not done. DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE! It will malfunction & all you will be left with is a really big paper weight. I will update if I ever hear back from Bryan.
UPDATE: I spoke with Amazon today after once again being told by Sunny Health that I needed a new motor(3rd one) Amazon very graciously has decided to refund my purchase minus a minor shipping charge even though it is past the normal refund time. Thank you, Amazon! And beware! DO NOY BUY this product. You will regret it!"
Very dissatisfied. Product arrived with the motor cover cracked. Immediately took pics and contacted amazon. Was told they couldn't replace but would contact manufacturer under their warranty and we would hear back within 24-48 hours. It has not been almost 3 weeks and no response. The cover won't even stay on when folded up because it is cracked at three of the four connected points. Lack of customer support is appalling considering it is under warranty.
This treadmill has a nice, bright display, and is fairly quiet. It's also nice and compact in terms of footprint. I did notice that there is nowhere to put my tablet, so I bought a clear bookshelf for the wall above the treadmill. I am having a hard time using this treadmill for a couple of reasons. First, the deck/belt is quite narrow--so occasionally my (quite large) foot lands on the stationary trim, grips it nicely, and the rest of me keeps moving--I have nearly died more times than I can count. So far, grabbing the handrail on my way down has saved my life. Unfortunately, if you grab the hand rails, it's easy to bump the integrated start/stop buttons and it stops the treadmill...while recovering from your near-death-experience, and the interruption of your running groove, you realize that touching the handrails wipes clear the time/distance data. Quite a few times, I have lost track of my workout because of this. That's annoying. The worst thing about this treadmill is that those hand rails are hard and scratchy on the end and angled downward at the ends)--and because of the narrowness of the belt, I am constantly bumping (hard) into them with my hands/wrists as my arms swing forward/upward, which creates scratches, bruises, and mid-workout cursing. I have tried training myself to run with my arms in tightly against my body, and without holding and/or moving my hand weights, but after several weeks, I realize that it is just not something that I am ever going to get used to. I have come to see that it isn't improving for me--I'm just a wild, arm-flailing runner. I have come to absolutely hate this treadmill--it looks nice, and it sounds nice, but I hate it. I am going to give away/sell this treadmill and replace it with one that has a wider belt, so I can regain my body space while I run. So, it might be fine if you've got the right body geometry, but at 5'4' and stoutly-framed, my arms are taking a beating. Perhaps someone taller, or shorter, or narrower, or more graceful could make this work--and it seems that many people here like it just fine--but if I were you, I wouldn't risk buying this treadmill unless you're already used to running on a narrow belt.
"Came well packed. Carton it was packed in was not damaged in any way. No problem setting it up, 8 screws (need hex nut driver but comes with it). When you pull it out of the box the cosole is laying on the treadmill already attached. You rotate it till vertical then put the screws in. One person job. Very easy. Works fine with my houshould outlet no need for an electrician. Has a very large beautiful blue backlit LCD with black numbers. I have walked 4 hours on it and have yet to bang my hands on the hand rails as others have complained about. For the first 3 days of walking I felt I had to direct my feet to the right spot. After that walking is normal so don't get discouraged with slim belt width at first. I have a Marfan Syndrom patient and am only allowed to get my heart rate up to 100bpm. Set the incline to flat and speed to 2.6 mph and got 100bpm on my Polar heart rate watch. The heart rate monitor on the treadmill matches up to what my Polar watch says. It doesn't work like I thought, you have to hold your hands on the sensors for about 30 seconds. When you first hold it it will start at 72 bpm and count up until it reaches your actual heart rate. Kinda annoying but because it settles and is accurate I will not ding it one star on the review. Will update review in 6 months or when or if I have a problem.
One motivating thing about his treadmill is how energized it is to start up and quickly. Jumps right to!
I've attached a picture of my size 12 shoes on the belt and my hand comared to the backlit LCD."
"This is a great treadmill. I read many reviews and spent a long time to decide on an under $500 treadmill. This hasn't disappointed and it's been about a month. I use this daily at a full sprint and regular walking/jogging as well. Like most treadmills in this price range, the belt width was something i didn't want to compromise on. I was weary after experiencing much wider belts at the gym, but this belt size didn't impact my running or workout. The quality is nice, it's heavy and well grounded. The panel is plastic and definitely not 'high-end' but unless you're expecting this to wow people with design, it's not even an issue. Easy to fold up and a cool slow release to fold back down. Just measure out your room and understand this will need a corner to hang out in as it doesn't fold completely down to hide under a bed or anything like that.
Pros:
-Easy to assemble. The box was a bit heavy - so have some help or get a dolly to help roll it around. It was well packed and even with a rough looking tear in the cardboard, the treadmill was nicely protected with foam, plastic wrap and more cardboard. Took maybe 30min to set it up.
- The folding makes it easy to store in a corner and not take up space when not using. It's in my home office and doesn't crowd the room at all.
- Simplicity. You turn it on and just go. The speed programs are nice, but lets be real, you're gonna be adjusting the speed manually most of the time. The screen is well lit, bright and has the basic information you need. Time..speed, distance..calories burnt etc..
- The speed controls are also on the right handle which is very convenient. Also, on the left handle, a basic Start/Stop option. I rarely touch the actual panel in the front to adjust speed or turn on.
- The belt seems to be strong and it is easy enough to lubricate. I had to tighten the belt after feeling like it was slipping at a full sprint, but with the allen tool they provided, it was a very easy and simple fix. There are plenty of videos on youtube that will show you how to properly do this, as well as the user guide.
- It runs quiet but once you start running it's a bit loud. But you're running on a metal board...so get headphones or turn on music.
- You don't need to have some monthly subscription to actually use it. It is a basic treadmill. Start it. Run on it. Get fit. Find training videos on youtube.. they're free and effective.
Cons:
- The heart rate monitor doesn't seem to be accurate at all. I don't really care much about this especially since i use a fit bit. Again, it's not the point. You use this to run on. Keep your expectations within your price range.
- Manual incline - but again, not a deal breaker. If you're wanting automatic/advanced inclines, you won't be spending under $500.
- Handles have rough ends and sometimes while in a sprint, my hands/arms might graze them. It's not hard plastic, but just rough padding ends i guess. A bit annoying but nothing serious.
- The two cupholders are a bit shallow, but they easily hold a typical bottle of water in place even when running on it.
- It has an area for you place a tablet on the main panel, but it's not that large. I place my phone there though with no issues.
Overall, it's a great entry level treadmill to have around your office or home gym. I enjoy walking on it, doing some HIIT exercises on it and jogging. I will always prefer real running, but this is a great option for cold weather and rainy days. The price is great, and it delivers a solid option to get into shape. Whether you choose this or another, don't get analysis paralysis! Get it ordered and on the way so you can hit those fitness goals!"
"Ordered this on 12/13/2015. Finally broke, inverter went bad, on 2/17/2018 after just over 1000 miles on it.
Overall I have to say I've been happy with it. The issues that others have brought up are true, but it got the job done and meet all my expectations for something at this price point.
I actually bought another one as a birthday present for an older friend who is getting too old to go for his walks outside in the winter.
Quality control seems to be the biggest issue. I did notice the fit and finish of the second one was better than the one I received.
Currently have an email in with Sunny Health & Fitness to see about buying the parts I need to fix the thing. I'll base my decision on fixing, buying another, or buying something else off of what happens next. Hopefully they'll get back to me in a timely manner and have the parts in stock for a reasonable price.
[UPDATE 2/23/18] Got in touch with Sunny Health & Fitness on this issue. They have agreed that the problem is with control board, which has the transformer on it. The problem is, it is the Chinese Lunar New Years so there is a 4-8 week delay in getting me a replacement. While I can understand not wanting to tie up money in spare parts inventory, I would have expected at least a few days/weeks worth in order to bridge this very well know shutdown time. Given the date I called this problem, the date of the holiday, and the expected wait, it appears they have no spare parts inventory which would lead me to believe, if you need parts for the thing there will be a minimum of 4 weeks to get something put in a container to be put on a boat and shipped to the US.
[UPDATE 3/29/18] Sent an email to ask about the status of the part I need. Got a reply that they still had no idea of when to expect to get what I need. Was also told that the 10A version of the board is no longer being made so I will be getting the upgraded part, which conflicts with what I was told a month ago. Changing my rating to 1 star with the hopes that I will actually get the thing fixed in the next month and get to update it to something higher in the future. Although I did get 2 years use out of the thing, having it out of commission for what could be over 2 months because of an unavailable part for a product currently being sold points to a lack of thinking on the manufacturers part, which to me says you should buy someone else's product."
"This product is so loud that it is useless. Sounds like it will explode at any moment. The company does not care.
Update 9/25/2020- sent SIX emails to customer service. Included a video so they can hear how bad it is. They responded once asking for the serial number. I responded and included another video showing it had only gotten worse. No further response despite multiple emails. The company does not care.
Update 11/13/20- the motor has ˜settled in' and is less noisy, sounding more like I expected it to. I cannot make it four or five stars because of customer service at Sunny. When I continued to email them about the issue they responded wot their own email after a week saying I need to be patient and they will help me when they can. So they expected me to pay hundreds of dollars for the product and let it sit useless for weeks until they got to me."
It does not work. Waited for slow delivery because of the pandemic...OK. Received it, assembled it, plugged it in, nothing happens. Emailed manufacturer, got a reply a week ago that they are slowed down, presumably by the pandemic. So here I sit (without walking on the treadmill) watching the purchased protection plan count down. Hope the company will come through for me.
"To start off I needed to keep up with a cardio workout after finishing a rehab program. I don't like to cold weather so a treadmill was my option. Traffic where I live is like being on RT 95 in rush hour. So, with that said I started reviewing foldable tread mills as I don't have a lot of space.
I did a lot of research on size and cost and decided on this purchase. Shipped and arrived in 3 days. I was one of the lucky ones as it arrived undamaged.
The hardest part of assembly was getting it out of the box. A monkey can assemble the machine. 10 bolts and its up and running. Folding running deck makes it possible to move around fairly easily.
This is a simple treadmill. The deck is large and there is plenty of room to walk or jog. I was impressed with the size and space. The computer is user friendly and simple to operate. Large readout of speed, time, distance, etc. The preprograms are cool but I really haven't used them at this point. The manual include is easy to change. I looked at Sunny auto incline but fewer moving parts leaves fewer parts to break. Folding mechanism is straight forward and works as advertised. The motor is a 2.2 hp and runs surprisingly quietly and smoothly even at higher speeds. The cup holders are big enough for a water bottle, so no complaints there as other customers have complained about. Tablet shelf is large enough to hold a tablet. A rubber mat under the machine is a must whether it sits on carpet or floors. Its not a heavy machine and along with the shock absorbers the rubber mat is a must.
Lubing the machine is easily done and MUST be initially done prior to use. The factory aligned the belt and after several uses has stayed straight and tight. Include is the adjuster tool and instructions for adjustment if and when its needed.
Overall, very happy with this purchase. Solid construction, small size but good sized deck and simple ease of operation makes this a good choice for the price range. This is not a thousand dollar plus gym machine. But if you are looking for a descent machine under $300.00 this machine is a good investment."
Very easy to assemble however there is bending in the metal near base where the screws were to hold the unit closed. Was unable to get those screws all the way back in after placing the 3 allen screws on each side. Not sure if that will pose any safety issues. After I stood up to screw in the Allen screws to the top console, that's when I noticed a crack and discoloration in the right cup holder area. I'm very disappointed.
"This has been a dream for me during the pandemic now that it's too cold out for me to walk. I walk on it everyday for 30-45 mins and then run on it for 10-20 mins after strength training. I needed something not too tall bc I have a low ceiling in the basement, and this fit great! I am only 5 foot 2 so I can use it well, my ceiling is only about 6 foot 3 in height.
Pros: easy to adjust the runway, light to move, easy to fold and store, works well for walking AND running which surprised me, does not sway around even when I'm sprinting, stays steady throughout my workout, I like the incline options. A BIG plus is that my shins don't hurt at all and usually at the gym the treadmills really hurt my shins with sprints and longer runs, so the shock absorption must be really good on this.
Cons: I don't think the holes for the water bottle and phone are deep enough. One day I grabbed the side handles too hard and the water bottle toppled right out of the holder. The top holder doesn't quite fit my iPad when it is horizontal, but it has a good fit for it vertical and for my iPhone, they don't move at all as I run."
"This one worked only for a month then the motor stopped working. Amazon could not help as the item was out of 30 day return period. I purchased a 3rd-party warranty, which could not also take care of the issue because of the manufacturer's warranty (6 months) was still active.
However, the manufacturer does not respond to my request to take care of the issue. They don't pick up the customer's service phone and do not respond to emails. This is by far the most horrible customer service experience I have ever experienced.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT AND COMPANY."
Updating my review because at first I gave it a 1 star because it did not work. It's very easy to put together. The company has absolutely amazing customer service. They respond right away. They sent me a new treadmill since the first one did not work and kept up with me to make sure when I got it set up that it worked and I had no problems! It did work this time! I had some minor cracks in a couple things on the treadmill and they immediately sent out new replacement parts. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star is because of all the hassle of carrying the treadmill inside and back out for the garbage and then another new one in. But it's a very nice light weight treadmill that works for someone who just wants to run every now and then. If you are a hardcore runner I would probably pay more money for a treadmill. For me trying to lose weight after babies and now keep in shape while being pregnant it's absolutwlt perfect!
I bought this treadmill in December, 2017. This is August, 2018 and the motor went bad. This treadmill didn't last even one full year! I'm a 4 foot 11, 125 pound woman.....I didn't exactly wear it out!!!!!!!
"The packaging was well designed and worked. No damage in shipping about 120 lb item. The installation manual was very well written and easy to understand however the diagrams were useless. The unit worked well provided you are not used to gym models. The belt is narrow however that is really not a issue however the hand rails are also narrow and that is an issue. If you are accustom to swinging you arms while you walk on the treadmill you will hit the end of the hand rail with the back of your hand unless you walk near the end of the unit.
After using the treadmill for 58 days it would not retain the set speed. The unit would gradually slow down then immediately return to the set speed. Very dangerous sudden burst of speed I almost fell off. During the Covid-19 out break the Sunny offices were closed with no technical support. However Amazon extended it return policy during the pandemic and I was able to return to Amazon with free UPS pickup. I have placed an order with Amazon for another treadmill from a different manufacture with a wider belt.
I would purchase NOT purchase again."
This treadmill may not be the best choice for everyone. Treadmills are hard to judge out of context. This one is small, has a rather short and narrow track, is rated only up to 220 pounds, and has a top speed of only 9 mph. For some buyers these will be significant limitations. But I the Sunny SF-T4400 was exactly what I wanted: a light-weight, rather basic treadmill to add to my small indoor gym to use on days when the weather is not conducive to walking outdoors. I researched the best choices on Treadmills Guru's website, and found exactly what I was looking for. This treadmill is perfect for walking and fits easily into my small garage gym alongside an exercise bike and an elliptical machine. The treadmill weighs only a little more than 100 pounds and was extremely easy to assemble and move into position. My only disappointment was discovering that one of the rear covers was damaged in shipping (looks like the box was probably dropped on that corner and the impact cracked the cover. Everything worked perfectly, but the cracked cover was not very attractive. So I emailed Sunny's customer support, and they replied immediately, asked me for some information about the damage, and sent a replacement part the next day. I've now received the replacement cover and the machine is perfect. I was very impressed with the way Sunny handled my issue. They were very concerned that I be satisfied with my purchase. If you are in the market for a lightweight, light duty treadmill with all the basic features -- cushioned deck, quiet motor, heart-rate monitor and easy-access controls on the handle bars, soft drop mechanism, etc.) check this one out. I think it's a pretty good buy.
Product missing pieces. Belt is on crooked. Plastic on machine is all cracked. Oil to lube the track was not sealed and leaked all over the machine. Very disappointed
The box was very heavy for two elderly gents! We did manage to unpack it and put it together. Turned it on and "nothing" ... I was fairly upset ... called the company and was told to send an email which wouldn't be answered for two or three business days. I decided to take the cover off of the motor where the wiring was and found two wires that either had not been attached or had come unattached during shipping. Plugged them in and away it went and I've been very pleased with it ever since. Runs very quietly. I did put it on a pad.
I normally don't leave reviews but I had to for this! I'm a 5'5 female and weigh about 150lbs. I bought this because of the pandemic and gyms being closed. I'm a runner who loves the luxury commercial treadmills like Precor but didn't want to spend that much for something temporary. I typically do about 3-5 miles at 7-8mph. I was not expecting this treadmill to be perfect but I am so happy with it! It's like your average hotel treadmill if not better. I was honestly expecting a rickety piece of junk but it's not. It's sturdy and comfortable for the price. I think if I take care of it and lubricate the running belt enough, it'll be just fine. I don't smack my hands on the rails very often like other reviewers have said but it is definitely narrow. My only complaint is that the entire treadmill slowly slides backwards on my garage floor while I'm running. I think this was made for less slick surfaces like carpet. But it's not a dealbreaker for me - it'll be a simple fix. So far, I've run 3 miles/day on it the past 3 days at 7.5mph and it's working great. I've even gone up to 9mph for some quick intervals. If you're expecting something perfect that will last forever, this probably isn't for you. But if you're like me and just need something cheap in the interim, it's great.
First I'd like to say the treadmill is a lot bigger than it seems. I'm 5'2 weight about 160 and this treadmill is perfect for me. If you are like me and like to walk and jog this is the treadmill for you. I also run on it, it is very sturdy it doesn't take very long to put together. I am giving this five stars because it works great, no issues so far, and I love the fact that my tablet holds on it. The only issue I have is that when I received it the belt cover at the end of the belt came damaged through shipping but it doesn't do anything besides protect the belt, it is just a plastic cover. No damage to the machine . Overall great I hope whoever is looking for a treadmill finds this helpful.
I bought this tread mill in April 2019, for a bit over $300.00. And it worked well for about a year and a half. We used the machine for slow walks, we are in our early 70s. Our average speed is about 2.4 MPH, with the max being about 3.0 MPH. I also lubed the belt as required and on schedule. After about a year, it started to make some noise, not enough to keep you from hearing the TV as we walked, so I thought it was just a wear issue. I did not find any instructions to oil or grease the bearings and the motor is a sealed unit so there is no access to it. Yesterday the machine just stopped working. It won't even run empty. I think this is a pretty rotten deal. The last treadmill we bought was from Sears and it lasted for nearly 15 years, and we were a lot younger back then and used the machine much harder, so to say the least we are VERY DISAPPOINTED! I do not recommend buying this unit!
"Delivered early. Wasnt expecting much given price, but quiet impressed. I wouldnt use for heavy running use, though. I bought to walk on during pregnancy.
Assembly took about 30 min. W my husband. He had a hard time adjusting the belt, but was able to vet it even. Machine isnt too loud and is def smaller and compact. Would not be great for tall or wider ppl i would think.
The incline at 4% seems not even noticeable, but it's fine. I need to keep active and this seems that it should be perfect.
Now, let's see if it lasts! I bought the extended warranty...but some reviews are a bit scary. I managed to pass ordering, delivery and installation hurdles ...so fingers crossed!"
Let me preface this by saying I am not a runner. I do not enjoy running in the slightest. My husband is also not a runner & has never been someone to exercise but decided he wanted to train to run a 5K. Once I saw him running I decided I wanted to as well. And 4 days a week over the summer we did just that. But then Fall hit in the PNW & we quickly realized we really do not enjoying running in the cold/rain. We decided we would have Santa bring us a treadmill for Christmas. Our budget didn't allow for much & as we are not true runners we didn't need or want all the bells & whistles. We decided to risk it & this is the one we chose. I˜ve only ran on it the last two days now & as I use to run at a gym I can tell this one is not nearly as substantial as the ones you'd see in a gym but I don't by any means feel it is going to collapse under me. It doesn't have any fancy settings but ya know what I can do on it? Run. I can change speed, & see how long I've been running which are the only two things I am really looking for. (Like I said, I am not a true runner.) As far as folding it up I can't speak to as we thankfully have a space where ours can stay out the whole time. But I will say as a 30 something mom of two toddlers this is a gift to me mentally. I don't like running, I don't like the way my body feels running but, if I'm having a bad day or am stressed I can go get on the treadmill as a cranky mom & come off of it as the mom I prefer to be with a brighter more positive attitude. Even just doing a good speed walk on it feels great. 20mins of running can really change my headspace for the better & for that reason alone this treadmill is worth it to me. Knowing I can just take that little bit of time, whether it's while my kids are playing or after they go to bed, it's a gift. So if you are a 30 something mom or a whatever age mom & you just need 20 mins of a healthy focus on you then I would recommend this. 2020 was a tough year, reality is 2021 likely won't fair much better. Treat yourself.
This worked great for just past the warranty which is only 3 months. During the 4th month of use, as I was jogging along at 5.8 miles per hour (I usually jog a half hour each day. I'm only 125 pounds, so I wound not call this excessive use). It just cut out as if someone pulled the plug from the wall. I tried plugging it in to a different wall socket, thinking at first I may have tripped a circuit. (The unit supposedly contains it's own overload protection trip switch, and you're not supposed to use an UPS with it.) The power light at the base of the unit was on, so I knew it was getting power, but nothing I did got it to start up, again. My boyfriend is quite handy, so he took a look at it and tested the engine which is still in working order. Apparently, the part that has gone bad is the circuit board, shown here. I called, reached a voicemail which directed me to email, sent an email, and hours and hours later, have yet to hear back. I'm also reaching out to Amazon where I purchased it. Perhaps I will upgrade my rating if they finally get back to me and send me a new circuit board, but as it is, I'm very disappointed that it only lasted less than 4 months. I was hoping to at least get a couple years out of it. We followed the directions exactly, but it seems like they must be using very cheap electrical parts. It was deployed on a level, hardwood surface with a mat as advised, and I even bought the belt lube and made sure to keep it well maintained. There is no excuse for it already going bad. Very disappointing. The planet and your wallet will be much better off if you go to another company and spend a little more to buy a better product.
"Very simple treadmill. Easy to install. Easy to fold. Used it for 6 months putting on average 40 miles per week on it.
There was a recurrent issue with the belt positioning. The directions aren't clear but you need to tighten on the side where the belt is veering towards, and loosen on the opposite direction. You basically need to do this while the belt is on a low speed to shift in place.
Also I had this on a cement floor in my garage so it would constantly move backwards during my runs. I had to put rubber underneath it to keep it stationary. Even though I would consistently lube the belt this treadmill is extremely noisy and I would not recommend it for an attached apartment.
After six months the on/ off switch burnt out. When I opened it to try & repair the fuse running to the on/ off switch had burnt. Conveniently this was right after the six month warranty had passed. I wouldn't recommend this treadmill to anyone, there are better options at this price range. In you're looking for a portable walking treadmill look into maybe the Superfit 2-1 folding."
It's a small and easy to manage equipment. Runs smoothly too. The only down side I have noticed to date is that it is very narrow. I hit my arm on the side handle when walking. So, I have to adjust that. I'm 5'2" and 140lbs. I imagine that a person that is much heavier and/or wider on the hips than I am would find it a little challenging. Other than that, it is great and would fit a small space, which is the reason I purchased it.
I found this treadmill on a search for best treadmills for small spaces and this one was one of the cheaper models listed in the top 10 best compact treadmills. They ranged from $1000-$300. Its great! I work out at a gym so if you are looking for one of those big treadmills this isn't it. This is perfect if you can't get to gym and you want to do a quick workout at home! My family and I are so excited to use it. One more tip- I ordered the assembly feature for $80 but after Reading the reviews we read it was very simple to assemble. It's true!!! If my husband and I can put it together- anyone can. Took us less than 30 min!!! The treadmill lubrication was easy after I you tubed it! We just got it today and I'll try and update my review after a few months! UPDATE: We've had this for over a year and still love it. Their customer service is awesome too. We've lost the key 2x and we paid fir a replacement and was shipped fast. Perfect treadmill for price and small space.
I like to be home, indoors. I decided to buy a less expensive treadmill to make sure I didn't just use it as a clothes hanger! I loved the size, ease of use, and it was relatively quiet. No fitness memberships to buy, just something to walk/jog on. I was doing great! 6 days a week, 30 minutes a day brisk walking/jogging. It died less than 3 months in! I didn't expect something of this price to last forever but not even 3 months?!?! I did all the recommended oiling maintenance, it is in my bedroom, plugged into a wall outlet with the recommended voltage. There is NO reason for a complete mechanical failure. I haven't heard back from sunny health and now I have a worthless treadmill that I will likely have to pay to dispose of. I thought the machine would last a year and would be less than a gym membership to find out if I would use it/like it. Less than 3 months fell extremely short of my expectations. I'm so disappointed and now with shelter in place orders treadmills are hard to come by. I just hope this helps someone else make a better choice.
Great treadmill for all! I've been an avid runner my entire life and can say this is a pretty decent and affordable treadmill. I cannot say that it's top notch because it's top speed is just 9mph. This was pretty much what I needed for when I can't go for a long run or just can't leave the house. The belt doesn't shift to the sides. And even if it were to, it would be easy to adjust since there are two spaces to do so. Everything came intact and was easy to assemble. When I'm sprinting at top speed I don't feel like it's going to split in half or cave in. It's pretty sturdy and I love that you can adjust speeds on the handle bars. All in all, for the price and quality I think I got a decent treadmill and I'd totally recommend it for others.
"I usually don't give out 1 stars.
I got this treadmill in May, and now it's June, it already has this loud weird noise in the motor, too loud that if I run on it, I think it will break.....
I˜ve sent email and call the customer service number but no reply? No one wants to go through the hassle of fixing this, just want to have a working treadmill !"
"I knew I was taking a risk being at the maximum weight capacity but I decided to chance it, as I have been steady loosing weight.
Walking on it I can feel resistance in the belt(I properly applied the lubricant that came with it) but funny enough when I run it works great, no resistance. I can run fine and comfortably on it which it great because I mainly got it to run.
It took me 1.5 hours to put together. All by myself, it was a little confusing, lots of screwing and unscrewing but I got it done fairly quick.
It's smaller than what I was used to at the gym but I knew what to expect when ordering, the panel is a little under chest level. Honestly I don't mind the size of it, doesn't hinder me in any way.
I decided to go with this one because it seemed to have the strongest motor compared to all the others in my price range $350-$450 AND manual incline, which is also something I was looking for.
So far so good."
"For a cheap treadmill it certainly does it's job. It's very thin, width wise, and fairly light weight so for me running is a bit iffy. Though I haven't had any trouble when I do. For walking it's perfect, and has kept me moving even during inclement weather. Which is the exact reason I purchased it.
It did arrive damaged, I assume during transport/delivery, but it was minor and non-mechanical. Amazon offered a percentage refund or return. I didn't care to try to fit it back in the box so I took the partial refund. It still works fine a year and a half later. Assembly was simple in my opinion. Though the box was heavy so I did need help getting it into the house. Once assembled, I'm able to move the machine around where I want pretty easily and by myself since it has wheels.
I don't use the different workout programs. However, I have tried them and they do work. The heart rate monitor seems to be ridiculously off when compared to my Apple Watch, so I don't recommend using it at all. I read somewhere that supposedly it has a BMI calculator? I haven't found that to be true, nor was I ever under the impression it came with one when I bought it. I don't care to have one anyways. I appreciate the cell phone/tablet shelf, but the LCD display is covered when using it. No biggie for me, may be a deal breaker for someone else. A nice added feature is the handrail controls. I use them pretty much exclusively during my workout. The manually adjustable incline is 0% to 5%, so if you're looking for more you'll have to find it elsewhere. Also, max speed is 9mph. Seeing as I don't go much faster than 5mph, I'm okay with that.
If you're looking for something you'd find in a gym setting you won't find it here. And you certainly won't find it at this price point. If you're looking for a treadmill to use when it's pouring rain or 20F outside and you're not really worried with bells and whistles, this may be something to look into."
"The treadmill arrived this morning. It was Fairly easy to assemble. I followed the directions to a T, however, it does not work. The computer screen comes on, but the belt does not move ....at all. I contacted the company Support. Was told to fill an online form. Once submitted, I received a message that I would receive a response in 5 to 10 business DAYS! This is not good business for a product that I have owned for less than 3 hours.
I am updating this review. After several hours if trying to get this machine to work, I discovered a loose wire. It dies now work, and I am pleased with it, however, I am not satisfied with their customer support services."
Put this product together in about 20mins after working 12.5 shift. This is smaller than the treadmills I am use to, however, after lubricating the running deck under the belt as manual advises and aligning the belt to make sure it's centered as manual details I was impressed! I then mounted one of my Arkon tablet 10.1 mounts to it and was on my way. In no time at all I walked 30mins. And, I like that you can choose timer mode for treadmill to go off once timer is up since I hate looking at clocks while working out. The treadmill runs smoothly. I noticed a slight bend in one of the metal posts and identical blemishes/defects in the arms. For that, I deduct one star. I recommend this for anyone 220lbs & under as product suggest who need a space-concious treadmill. Speaking for 5'0 people like myself, this is more than adequate for my needs.
"Posting here since I am not having much luck hearing back from customer service. Looks like other negative posts are getting some sort of response from customer service, so trying my luck here. My one star review is based on a combination of the lack of reliability of the treadmill and the lack of customer service support. Given the lower cost of this treadmill, perhaps the lack of reliability is somewhat expected so I'll gladly increase my review if customer service could promptly help get me up and running again.
This treadmill arrived late May 2019, so it's been a tad over a year, but the treadmill is already dead. Knowing this is a less expensive brand, I've maintained this thing well, read the manual and followed its recommendations. But it broke. When I power on the treadmill, it beeps, displays an E02 error message, and will not drive the belt. According to the manual, this error suggests there's an issue with the power to the unit. However, I tested the power at the outlet coming into the unit using a voltmeter, also tested connectivity of all the wiring inside the unit. I also plugged the treadmill into other outlets of the house and I get the same error. I finally tested the motor itself using a 9V battery and discovered the motor does not run at all. I verified the battery was good using my voltmeter, and also tried another new 9V battery as well. Based on this, it seems pretty clear the motor needs to be fixed or replaced.
I looked up the part number for the motor, and it does not seem readily available in the US, and the going rate seems to be around $200, which is 2/3 of what I paid for the treadmill. I've been reaching out to the Sunny Health & Fitness customer service team every day since July 26, 2020 for some help on this. They promptly responded to my first email, gave me a ticket number 21388596, and suggested troubleshooting steps. Within hours of that email and on the same day, I promptly followed their recommendations, tested the steps I hadn't yet tried, and reported back that the motor failed. They have been completely silent ever since. I'm just looking for some sort of help, whether they can help with the cost of the replacement motor, or help identify a substitute motor or parts for the motor that I can order and install myself.
I will update my review based on how things progress in the coming days.
UPDATE (Aug. 4, 2020):
After having been continuously ignored by Sunny's customer service (daily since July 26), I tried searching for a replacement motor to just purchase myself even if it would be out of pocket. I could not find a direct replacement online at least in the US, and the cost were around $200. So I reached out to three different treadmill part vendors online for help asking if they carry motors for this treadmill or if they have substitute motors they could recommend. All three responded saying they do not support or carry parts for this treadmill. Something to consider when purchasing this treadmill. This brings me back at the mercy of Sunny's unresponsive customer service and to a dead end.
Out of frustration, I have reached out to Amazon's customer service to see if there was anything they could do for me (e.g., contacting the seller for me or finding some other workaround). Amazingly, even though my order was placed over a year ago, Amazon's customer service has graciously offered to help and is currently in the process of finding a way to either get me a replacement or a partial refund. I'm going to say my issue is now resolved completely thanks to Amazon and no thanks to Sunny. So 1 star for Sunny (would be less if I had the option), and 5+ stars for Amazon."
The saying goes you get what you pay for. Well I ordered this at a great deal back in January. I didn't know the world was about to shut down, but the timing ended up being perfect. I waited months to review because I wanted to see how it would hold up. It has done great. It was very easy to assemble. It fits right in the corner of my guest bedroom and easily folds up out the way. It has held up very well over the past 10 months. Maintenance is very minimal. I deducted one star only because the incline is pretty much non existent. Other than that, I would highly recommend this treadmill to anyone looking for an affordable option for at home workouts. It hold up to fast runs and is perfect for a long moderately paced walking workout.This treadmill is a basic machine, but it gets the job done.
I bought this product about 2 years ago. I haven't using it for a long time and recently I found it didn't work. I bought the 3-year protection plan before so still eligible to get it fixed., I tried to contact the repair service by phone call, email, none of them worked for me. I don't know where I can find the customer service for the 3 year protection plan and get it fixed.
"I'm so excited! With crazy delivery delays and treadmills running out of stock because of the holiday, I ordered this Thursday night and it was just delivered a day early! It's so cold and rainy here in northeast Ohio and I'm going crazy being stuck inside instead of out at the parks hiking. First, I'll say, I am a female, 52 years old and I unboxed and put this thing together by myself in about 15 minutes. Couldn't have been easier! The instructions look scary, so just know all you need to do is screw in about 10 screws and that's it. Watch a You Tube video to see exactly what to do. I made sure the folding mechanism worked (it did), I switched the incline (also super easy), I lubed up the belt (make sure you do that before using) and I adjusted the belt a bit (it was over to the left). All very easy to do. Powered it up, jumped on and I am in heaven! Belt size is great, the handlebars don't bother me or get in my way at all (I'm 5'6""). Console is clear and concise and there are two cup or phone holders. I'm about to take it for a spin right now so I'll update this review after I've had it for a bit. So far, it's perfect!!
Update: I've used this treadmill everyday walking 2 miles a day. It works great and I have no complaints EXCEPT some other reviewers are correct, the handlebars are in the way. I always hit my wrist and my Fitbit on the left bar while I walk. I so wish they were a bit higher or lower. So, unless your arms are at a 90 degree angle the whole time, you'll probably hit the bars with your hands. Not the end of the world. Everything else is great."
"I was so excited to use this treadmill. It arrived in a box. Me and my husband worked really hard to get it up through the stairs to our second floor apartment. We thought our hard work was going to pay off once we could set it up and start using it. We plugged it in and it wouldn't even turn on. No power in the console! Called Sunny health and they said to check if all the wires were connected. We opened the console and all the wires seemed intact but it didn't start. Sunny Health said they would send a new monitor which we have to install ourselves and replace the old one. It would reach us in 6 weeks or more because of the pandemic!
We didn't have that much patience and we didn't know if the new monitor would work or if we would be able to attach it. So we did the hard work again to pack it and send it back. Such a terrible and painful experience! Don't buy this piece of junk."
"Bought this machine for our daughter 8 months ago Mar 7 2020 threw this machine in the county dump Nov 28 2020. Had to replace motor running belt approx. 3 months after purchase which required taking the machine apart. Running track split in half while my daughter was exercising on this machine thankfully she was not seriously injured. She is a full time college student so this machine was not being used every day. There is no way I would recommend this product for anyone to buy. When we had to order drive belt
to replace we had to jump through hoops just to get it from the company. Buy at your own risk."
"I've had this treadmill for about 10 weeks now, using it about 2x/week (30-40 minutes a time), and I'm quite happy with it. I got it because my outdoor runs are so often in bad weather, late at night, and hard on my knees, I needed an indoor alternative. It is serving that purpose well. Some details that might be helpful:
-Assembly was simple in concept, but required a good deal of strength and a 2nd person to help line things up right for the bolts.
-As you would expect, it is smaller and less sturdy than a commercial treadmill you find at a gym. At first I needed to focus carefully on my balance and foot placement, but I soon got used to it and can now jog without worry. I am 5'9"" and 180 pounds.
-It is built at a slight incline, which I like because it best simulates outdoor running. A perfectly level treadmill feels ""downhill.""
-I have not had any problems with the belt shifting out of alignment.
-The cup holders are a bit small and, annoyingly, not deep enough to hold a cell phone or a tall water bottle safely.
-There is a thin ledge across the screen which is perfect for holding a phone, but the phone will then block at least half the readout of the screen.
-The pulse measure takes a long time (like 2 minutes) and doesn't feel super accurate.
-The calorie count is lower and therefore more accurate than commercial treadmills--but these are always best ignored anyway.
-Oddly, it feels faster than commercial treadmills. Like, I use 5 mph for my main jogging speed on it, and it feels comparable to 6-7 mph on a larger treadmill. I don't know if this is actually a different speed or just a different feel because of the smaller size."
I've been using my treadmill for a couple of weeks now and I really like it. But what I don't like is that I cannot adjust the display. I'm fairly tall at 6'1", and because I can't adjust the display, the way it is positioned with my height, the numbers on the display disappear. Anytime I want to read them, I have to stoop down while running which is uncomfortable and a little dangerous. I wish there were a way to raise the display for taller runners. Besides that, out of the box the incline defaults to the most difficult grade. For those who want to "hit the ground running", this may need to be adjusted which is an extra, unexpected step to take.
"I was doing great keeping up on my running until our gym closed due to covid. My main activity is cycling and I was good doing that all spring, summer and fall, but with winter approaching I nabbed this treadmill figuring that it would fill the activity void over the next 3-4 months. A friend got a much more expensive name brand treadmill, and good for her, I'm sure it will last forever. I'm not making a life purchase, I just need to get through this season - and this is the treadmill for me. It does go up to 8mph, though currently my max is 6.5, so this is great. It lasts the full time I run (currently about 30-40 min) and I have had no issues with it.
Now - this is not a $1500 treadmill, it's a $300-400 treadmill and it has all the cheap cuts you would expect. The safety string is practically floss and it doesn't take much to knock it off. I haven't had trouble with it and am careful where my arms go. I still haven't figured out how the incline works and if it does work it can't do much more than lift you an inch or two higher. It rattles quite a bit and I'm glad I don't have downstairs neighbors or sleeping kids nearby. I don't use the pulse tool and don't expect it to work. To my surprise the handle buttons work great and I use them as my main speed changer while I'm running.
In short - this is a great treadmill and it works great for what it is. I'll be pleasantly surprised if it lasts over a year, but I am still moving."
If you're like me, you're probably scrolling through all of these bad reviews and thinking about not getting this treadmill. But, after some thought, I ended up taking a chance and just ordering it. I wanted a treadmill that I could walk and run on for cardio, but I did NOT want to invest thousands of dollars in it for obvious reasons. So I ordered this one that was under 400. A lot of reviews were saying that the treadmill stopped working for them after a month or so and that it wasn't sturdy at all, waste of $$, etc. I don't think this was a waste of money at all. Iv'e had this for months now and haven't run in to any problems. The biggest issue (and the reason I only rated 4 stars) is that it is a little difficult to set up if you don't at least have a little help or are really good with handy work. Pretty much all the tools you need are included, it's just a little touchy when it comes to adjusting the screws and stuff. But, I run on it weekly and it hasn't shut down on me or anything yet, and it didn't come damaged at all. If you want a treadmill and don't want to spend a lot of money, you should try this one.
Within 2-3 days of using the treadmill, i have received multiple complaints from the neighbors about the pounding noise. I have only been walking on it at max speed of 2.5. Never ran on it. Not even for testing the higher speed. Im 160lb. The shock absorption is completely ineffective, in spite of using a 1" thick ProsourceFit mat under the equipment. I cant return the equipment, since i have discarded all box and packaging elements. My neighbors wont let me use it either. It is the dumbest investment I ever made. What a waste. People in apartments, please double think before buying this. This wont work for apartments.
"My friend helped assemble it in 30min using the tools the treadmill came with. Delivery was much earlier than I anticipated. I had a few hiccups trying to figure out how to use the ""mode"" - it can only set when the machine is stopped (not running , not paused). So we cannot update the time or distance whn in motion or paused. Reccomend they add these instructions to the manual. Machine is light. Folds up n down easily but not fully vertical n still takes space. I got the reccomended floor mat n extra lubricant. So far, so good.
Update in 2months - As noted in other reviews, belt slips and needs to be adjusted a 2nd time now... this is after 2 months of use, approx 1hr , 3-4 times a week, on max incline.
I still like the machine and think it is a good buy for the price."
Read a lot of reviews and was in between a few folding treadmills but very thankful I chose this one! My husband is 6'2 and I was worried about his height and stride with a finding treadmill but this one is perfect and we both feel like we have plenty of running area! Sturdy and not too loud. Easy to assemble and to move it around with the wheels on it. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a folding treadmill!
I paid about $ 350 including tax for this treadmill , decent for the price but like other reviewer said. , you will keep having to have do belt justments maybe daily .. this machine do have a big flaw with the belt staying Center .. I took two pictures of the rear of the belt with measurements . this keeps my treadmill 95% centered.. but almost daily with use I might have to do a quarter-turn adjustment either way .. on both sides.. I'm keeping it , it's a decent treadmill .. but this is one of the annoying things about this treadmill.. the struggle is real
I think this is a good treadmill for the price. Easy to store away and small enough to fit in a corner. My complaint is the belt. It keeps bulging up in places and it slips back and forth if you are going at a speed below 3.2 we have to fix it every time we go to get on it. But it goes right back to where it was. Very annoying. Also the handle bars are too narrow so I keep hitting the back of my hands on them when I walk.
"Weak motor. Belt slips.
Im a male, 175lbs. I usually run on treadmill at anspeed of 6-8
The belt slips pretty often and it makes you feel not safe at all.
Other than that, the belt is narrow, very limited funtions on the computer, takes forever to measure the heartbeat and etc. but they are all fine. I dont expect much from this inexpensive machine.
I would've been happy if it gave me an sturdy feeling of the running belt on my workout.
So if you weight more than 159-160, and if you are planning to run faster than 6, you better consider another product."
I've had this treadmill for about 2 weeks, I run about 3 miles a day, 5 days a week, and it's pretty good for what I need. It made a knocking sound the first time I used it, but that went away by the next time I used it. It is quite heavy (about 100lbs), but I'm 5'6 ~140lb female and I managed to slide the box through the house by myself. Taking it out the box took a lot maneuvering on my part, but I think that was the hardest part. Because it is so heavy, and I was doing this by myself, I put it together where I wanted it rather than put it together and then try to move it. Putting it together was very easy. If you're mechanically inclined, you probably won't need the instructions. It did arrive with some cosmetic blemishes, but it doesn't affect it's functionally. It doesn't have a fan, a jack for your iPhone, and the incline isn't that great, but it's not a $1000 treadmill you find at a commercial gym. So, it's pretty basic and maybe a little ghetto, but it does a good job for a very cheap price.
Fantastic, especially for the price. It's nice and sturdy, doesn't feel flimsy or easily breakable. I do agree with another review I saw that it's probably not the best machine for walking as the handlebars are pretty narrow and I've smacked my hands on them several times while doing my warm-ups and cool-downs. But for running, it is perfect! I'm so glad I made this purchase.
It really is as described. The hardest part for me was getting it in my house, as it was not delivered on the date specified (I was actually asked on which date I wanted it), nor the door - but my kind neighbor helped me with that part. After that, it was as simple as tightening 6 screws and oiling the running board. I use it a few times a week. I will keep a log as to how often I oil it, so that it prolongs the life of the product...also, turning off the treadmill with power switch prolongs the life, as well. Very happy with Sunny Health & Fitness products. I bought a rowing machine in the beginning of the pandemic, and it is awesome.
I've only had for a week but I am really happy with it so far. I'm not an athlete or any serious trainer so this works for what I need it for. My biggest complaint about this treadmill is the placement of speed buttons. I prefer not to touch the control panel anytime I'm working out bc I tend to step off the tread onto the base so I do rely on the arm buttons. It is hard to change the speed while trying to accelerate your speed or decrease bc the buttons are very small and very close to each other . I often speed up when trying to turn down and vise versa. Being aware that this can happen is just an adjustment to not wait until the very last second of running to start decreasing your speed or you might get hurt. This is a nice lightweight machine and is fairly quiet..I actually wish it was a little bit heavier bc I notice the treadmill moving as I run across the room so I typically have to scoot back to the wall 1 to 2 times during which I'll buy a rubber mat for eventually but those run around $50 so it will increase the cost overall but oh well still not $1000 . The pulse reader is a joke on this machine though. My resting heart rate is always around 70-75 so when I just ran for 5 minutes straight and it says my pulse is 76 I know it's not even close. Knowing everything I do about this treadmill, I would absolutely still buy again. Hopefully it last a long time!
I've had my treadmill for a week and I am not happy at all with it's quality! Have used every day and without exception, had to adjust the belt after every use. The belt keeps going to the right side and start making squeaking sounds. It is very annoying that a brand new treadmill has such a poor quality that it needs to be adjusted after every use, even though I never run it faster than 3.5mph. I's a shame since the product looks nice, but poor quality and I've unfortunately thrown out its packaging, otherwise I would have returned it and ask for a refund. Calling their help desk has not been useful as no one answers the calls.
"First impressions right out of the box:
” it was easy to set up
” it's easy to fold and move
” it's just the right size for the space
” the belt is quiet, and it speeds up fast and smooth
” I love that it's pink, I feel like Elle Woods while working out. HARVARD LAW HERE I COME!
I want to note that it's small. I'm very short ” barely five feet tall ” and it's GREAT for me. I mean, it finally feels like a my size treadmill as opposed to the giant treadmills at the gym that totally dwarf me.
Now, my husband is almost six feet tall, and when he got on it he had to stand pretty far back to keep his feet from hitting the front, and was very close to his stride coming off the back too.
Would this be a good treadmill for someone tall with a long stride? I sincerely doubt it. But it's great for my short little legs and I'm excited AF to lose this quarantine weight I gained!"
"We purchased this the end of January and have been using it every day. It has been a nice replacement until this morning. When you adjust the speed to what we've been using the treadmill is running about twice as fast as before. We have turned it on and off and still has the problem. We have loved it up till today.
We need help getting parts for this speed problem."
I purchased this item twice. It has really good features, it is easy to fold/unfold, and it is not super noise for a treadmill. My whole family use this item for cardio exercises, and we use daily, approximately we run 5 miles each day (total). So combination of price and features is superb. However, my first treadmill died (stopped working) after a year and something. It was after one year of usage and outside of the warranty window. Given that I liked the device overall, I bought another one, this time with an extended protection plan. This morning, when I was on the treadmill it first stopped, and then it started to burn. It literally started to burn, IT CAUGHT ON FLAME !!!! It was relatively small flame inside of the machine, it was clearly visible and started to produce smoke. I have not had any electrical equipment burning for the last 30 years, so it was somewhat new experience. I unplugged it, and used a fire extinguisher to put the flame down. Frankly, that was the first time I have to use an extinguisher, ever. I really would like to recommend having an extinguisher at your house, the extinguisher was totally worth the price, it not only extinguished the flame and provided me with confidence that some equipment can work flawlessly when you need it. However, I will NOT recommend the product (Fitness Folding Treadmill).
"I replaced my Weslo Cadence Treadmill with this one so my comparisons are relative. First of all the Sunny Treadmill is packed really good and the assembly instructions are easy to follow. The hardest part was getting rid of the packing material! I just hope this treadmill lasts as long as my Weslo (10 years 1 month).
I did lubricate the treadmill with silicone oil and I did have to align the walking mat (easy). The hardware for assembly is all the same (bolts with hex head Allen wrench which is supplied). This thing is quiet walking at 3.5 mph.
My gripes (and they're minor): I could use higher handles. When a book is placed for reading on the slot, it totally blocks the display. The side rails you stand on prior to getting on or off the treadmill are a little narrow (add a half inch to each side to make it safer)."
I bought this treadmill in 2017 and used it lightly running twice a week for 20 minutes @ average of 5.6 miles/hr. I did regular maintanace as per the manual like oiling etc. This morning it died on me and stopped working and I could smell something burning. I think the motor was charred as I could see some black powder on the floor. I will not recommend this. Also looks like a safety hazard. The previous one that I had worked for 10 years without issues.
"We just got this today and the vast majority of the assembly was getting it out of the packaging. It is HEAVY! Fortunately, the delivery guy put it right outside the front door so I was able to drag it in and basically push it down the stairs to the basement. Then I made sure the ""this side up"" was up and started using a blade to hack away at the cardboard packaging. All of that went pretty smoothly. It's still heavy, but I lifted up sides and slid out packing material as needed on both sides.
The directions clearly say to not cut the main/last piece of strap around the middle of the tread area. That works just fine. Then you unscrew the right side to clear a piece of metal that probably keep you from folding up the handles. Take out two screws from both sides there that bolt in the full length of the unit (unlike the 3 other screws that you will install next to them). Make note of which hole that one is and then you will put that one long bolt back into the same slot on both sides. Plus then install three additional bolts in the other areas. It does say when lifting the handles up for this part to be careful of crimping any electrical cabling. I didn't notice any issues or catches. There's one screw on the back side that you must use the small screw on because it cannot go through the cabling stuff.
The handlebar thing was easy - add four screws and done. You just have to find them! Some of those are pretty well hidden but then you'll ""aha"" it when you see them. The magnetic safety thing is in the other parts area - you have to plug that in and presumably it stops the machine from running if it pops out...attach it to your clothing and if you fall down it will pop out with you and stop the machine.
I had an initial ""oh crap, did I crimp the cabling"" when the machine didn't start for the first go. Then I remembered the fuse/switch on the front of the machine that must be flipped on.
I'll follow up after some steady usage. So far all I did was a quick 60 second test. I'm tired."
This product is no good. I used it for a month and it stopped working. The motor kept getting stuck and was a danger if you tried to use it. The first time it did it i almost sprang my ankle. I contacted customer service because it was well within the warranty and at first they responded but after all the things they had me check and do to the machine when it finally came down to what seems like the motor being the problem(i say seem because i have never heard back from them again) they never responded to my emails. Customer service is horrible as well as the product. I will not be buying from this company again.
I was not sure about ordering something this large and heavy for home delivery. I read the reviews that indicated setup was fast and easy so that added to my finally making the decision to go ahead and buy this treadmill. I needed something for 2-3 mile fast walks everyday that was easy to handle and durable. 5'3" and 160 lbs so this was the perfect size to continue my cardio and weight loss program. I am 72 and pretty fit (horses and hay bales) and I was able to assemble this treadmill (unpack and put together) with only a few minutes of help to hold the uprights in place while I put the 6 bolts in place. Directions were clear and easy to follow, setup was indeed a breeze, it really only took 10 bolts to complete assembly. My prior treadmill from Weslo came in many many pieces and I had to have a neighbor assemble, took over 2 hrs. So far I am more than happy with the treadmill, very quiet, console is compact which I love, my kindle fits prefect in slot, cup holders fit my drink bottle. Controls in handles are really nice increase/decrease speed, pause or stop. Love the soft drop deck, no heavy lifting to fold and unfold. I leave mine in place all the time but this is a great feature. For the price it is a deal. This thing was packed to survive some intense traveling and it came through fine.
"Just received my treadmill ( EARLY) and I was very excited. First, kudos to the delivery person because the box was super heavy!!!. Second, assembly took about 45 minutes and the first 25 was about unboxing and taking the machine out of packaging. Very well packaged, no damage or scratches, it was Perfect! Literally screwed in a total of 10 screws, plugged it in and started using it, it was that easy. Third, I was a little weary about the size from other reviews but it really is a good width and length... ( I am 5'5, 220 - husband is 5'9, 215)
Like I said this review is all about first impressions and I am more than satisfied! I cant wait to start using the machine tomorrow...Will update this review after some uses!!!"
Well, I gave this treadmill almost a full month of use and came to realization it clearly was not going to hold up to regular use very long. In less than 2 weeks, part number 32 (rubber cushion) on both sides of treadmill had already broken. Each seemed to have been smashed by part 7 (Fixing Pin) until they became so thin they split in half. By week 3, the motor/belt or something has developed a terrible clicking sound. I am 5'6 - 155lbs. Even a cheap treadmill should easily hold up to any amount of exercise I could do on it. On top of these issues, the LCD display is horrible. This is due to the way it is angled in mount on treadmill. Unless you are all the way forward on treadmill deck, you can barely read the display. The further back you are on deck when running or walking, the dimmer the display appears to the point you can barely read it. If it was angled correctly, it may be an ok display. Also, the device holder is right under machine display. Anything you put in device holder coverups up machine display. Meaning unless you move your device while running or walking, you can't see you metrics for exercise. Easy when walking, not so easy when you're running. Even if you literally only plan on doing light walking, I would probably go with a different treadmill. This treadmill simply didn't give me any indication it would hold up to regular use. I had higher expectations from this model. I realize it is in a low price point, but things falling apart in less than a month is just not acceptable. Very disappointed overall.
I recently purchased and set up the SF-T4400 model treadmill. It was very easy to set up thankfully. I used it for the first time yesterday to clock a five-mile run. However, after running an hour, it showed I'd only gone 3 miles. Yet, the pedometer I was wearing showed I had run 5.3 miles. Also, the 4mph setting is actually faster than 4mph. A 4mph is a standard walking pace for people but the 4mph setting on the treadmill is definitely a running pace. I couln't find any guidance in their manual or on the web for calibrating the settings. I sent an to the support and response time is about a week. That's understandable since I think a lot of people are purchasing treadmills these days. But I do hope they have a fix for me and I do hope that it's easy. Because being able to see your time/distance and being able to improve on it, is one of the nicest features of a treadmill.
"Just After five months smells like burning, although i use Lubricant regularly.
Even with speed of five out of ten, it barley moves."
We love this treadmill! When looking in sporting goods, or exercise equipment stores, we found that the treadmills they were selling were HUGE! Just way too big for our home. So I went looking elsewhere... Amazon because I could read the million reviews, and questions & answers. After reading about many different treadmills in the lower price range, we decided to go with this one. It is perfectly sized, not too large, but still sturdy. I use it for fast walking, my husband uses it for slower walking, just to get in his steps, and my son, a soccer player, uses it for conditioning by running. We all love it! My son uses the programs, and he's happy with those. It's easy to move around, and the belt lifts up to store in a smaller footprint; it's got hydraulics, so the belt is easy to lift, and it lowers itself slowly once you release the mechanism. I like the small "shelf" for an iPad, book, or remote control, and it has 2 spaces for generously sized water bottles (I use one for my water, and one for my phone). Changing the incline is done by hand (therefore, there is no change in incline included in the programs, but I knew that before I bought it) and is very easy to do. Don't let the extremely reasonable price make you think this may be an inferior product - it's holding up beautifully and we love it!
"This item came with several damaged components - badly cracked motor cover and one of the rear belt covers was smashed up. You have to go directly to the manufacturer with this - they make you send photos of the damage, a copy of the Amazon receipt, part numbers, mailing address, etc. I submitted this info. I received a number in response. After that - nothing. No acknowledgement, no promise of updates, no response to an email I sent them. This company seems to have no customer support at all. I would recommend staying away, since there is no way of predicting what will be broken during shipping.
As far as assembly goes, it was not too bad. Took us (my wife and I) about 2 hours. I am an engineer and I am used to assembling stuff, so it is not a total piece of cake, but don't think it is easy-peasy, either. Requires a lot of unpacking and following instructions. The treadmill is not especially compact when folded up and it is awkward to move around. I suspect we will only fold it when we desperately need the space. It is also fairly noisy. In order to use it while watching TV, the volume on the TV needs to be cranked up pretty high. It is certainly not gymnasium quality, but it does work - at least until those cracked parts completely break up."
Just finished setting this up today. Wife needed something a little less stressful than our Sole E25 eliptical (excellent product). We checked the customer reviews, questions, and youtubes before deciding to buy. This is a good product for a reasonable price. We are surprised that it's heavy-duty, also. We had only 1 small issue in setting it up. A couple of the bolt holes didn't line up and it would be easy to cross thread . I used a nailset to force the holes into alignment and finally got the bolts in place without damage. This comes very well packed and was not damaged--another surprise considering the weight. We followed the good directions for setup and operation. There are a number of reminders to oil under the belt before using the treadmill. I do wish that it folded up a smaller, but for the price. it's fine. Not at all difficult to move around compared to the elliptical that weighs 350 lbs. I took off a star due to the bolt alignment problem. So far so good. Not much noise at all.
"I've had this treadmill for about two weeks now. It's really exceeded my expectations. My husband and I were able to lug it upstairs to our bedroom, where I figured I would use it more (seeing it all the time) than if I had to go to the basement. It really fits nicely, not too huge. It didn't take very long to assemble and was very well packaged. The tread is long enough and wide enough, which, I was kind of worried about. The start/stop and speed controls on the handles are very convenient. I haven't tried any of the programmed walks, so, I can't comment on those. It seems really sturdy and well made. I'm 5'9 and the handles seem at a comfortable height for me.
Two things are cons for me. If these were improved I'd give five stars. One, the cup holders won't hold my 24 oz. Tervis cup. I'm not sure about a water bottle, this is the only cup I use all day and I don't buy bottled water. I can fit it in the cup holder, but it won't stand up. So, I set my water on the window sill next to the treadmill. I have found that an Echo Dot sits nicely on one of the cup holders, though! So, it's being used for that! Two, the little device holder shelf is too narrow and not long enough for my iPad. Also, when I am able to balance my iPad on it, the iPad covers up the treadmill data screen. I solved this by ordering an acrylic book holder made by SourceOne. It's 7x10 inches and basically hangs on the little shelf. I can set my iPad on this book holder and now see the data screen. It's now perfect!"
We loved how easy it was to assemble I felt like it pretty much came assembled we just had to put some screws on it. It's small enough to fit in our room and big enough to run on. My husband and I both love it. We've had it a little over a week. I honestly didn't think it was going to be a great buy because it was so cheap but it exceeds my expectations.
This was a surprise for me. Though narrow than I figured, overall the unit is very well made. I am a heavier person (over 200lbs) and do some moderate running on this machine. Over past three weeks, it has done a good job and is holding up well. I average 18-24 miles a week and I land heavy, but this treadmill does the job well. Note: for walking, my wrist will hit the hand rails, so I have slightly adjusted my arms for this. For running, no issue at all.
I've had this treadmill for close to a month now. I walk on it almost daily pretty fast (3.5 MPH) with a 15 lb weight vest on. I'm male, 47, 5'7" and currently weigh 150 lbs - thanks to this machine! Over the past month, I have dropped close to 14 lbs just by walking and using Intermittent Fasting. This treadmill works great for my purpose - which is just walking. I feel that the belt maybe too narrow to really run on. Also I am trying to be careful with it as I purchased the Weslo Cadence G 5.9 - not once but twice in 2014 and both times it was a disaster. I had to basically throw them away - the belt kept dangerously sticking while just walking even with regular lubrication - awful! This machine is smooth as heck! I really get a good sweat on in just 25 - 30 minutes - excellent. It does not make much noise at all. I am very happy with this treadmill. Also, it was a breeze to put it together and I have like no manual skills at all. It's a miracle I can open a door with a key! :-) But this assembly was a cinch. If you can't get the free installation you'll be fine. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to walk unless you are shorter and slighter than me in which case you maybe able to run on it as well. Great treadmill. Hope it continues to serve as well in the next few months to a year as it has this initial month!
Came with the rubber foot at the front missing making the treadmill wobbly. I had to repackage it back during the set up process without even turning it on. Great price but not so great quality.
"So far this is working well for what I purchased it for ” walking. It took about 20 minutes to assemble by myself but it was super easy to do! What took the longest for me was adjusting the belt, but in the end it's perfect. I've had it for about a week now and have used it every day for 45 minutes to an hour and a half each time and I have zero issues. There's also a review on here showing how they put a shelf on it to make it a walking desk.. and let me tell you that is a GAME CHANGER for me. I'm always studying for school, and being able to walk and study is a big deal for me.
The cup holders are meant for normal sized cups, and none of my water bottles fit into them. But that is not a deal breaker for me since I typically have the shelf on it and can just put my water jug/bottle on there.
I usually walk at a 2.6-3 speed and have had zero issues so far with anything about this treadmill. I'm hoping that it holds up. But for the price of it, I couldn't resist and and it's pretty decent quality. It does the job I need it to do and I cannot complain about that!"
Received mid-November. Used 3-5 x/week, walking for 30 minutes at max 3mph. Mid June 2020 motor began malfunctioning. Surprise, unexpected, irregular speed changes while in use causes loss of balance. Sunny Health customer service slow response. They finally just sent us email telling us how to order replacement motor. ($80.) must have PayPal payment first, then they will ship motor. PayPal confirmed payment and yet no communication from Sunny Health has been received. Reading other reviews this motor issue is a common quality complaint for them. Probably why it's only warranted for 6 months. You get what you pay for. I recommend you don't purchase this unit, for quality and safety reasons.
Love this treadmill! It was relatively easy to put together, although it helps to have a second person to move it as it is quite heavy! Works great for simple workouts! Some reviews mentioned the narrow belt but this has not been a problem for me. I have noticed two things that don't bother me but might affect someone else's decision to purchase. First of you put a phone or tablet on the little ledge, it will cover up the display. Also the power switch is one the back so if you have it in front of a wall, leave room to walk around it to kick it on and off. Great speed and accelerates quickly! Also like that I can adjust speed and start/stop the workout from the handlebars. The belt runs smoothly for me, make sure to use the lubricant before the first use. (I used a paper towel to apply it; if you can't reach all the way across there is a way to tighten or loosen the belt but I made it work). Love the cup holders and cell phone ledge as it helps the time pass!
"Within minutes of use the belt kept moving towards the left. It started scratching so much that I had to adjust it every 5 minutes. I contacted Sunny CS and got nothing but recommendations (tighten and loosening the bolts) that are already in the instruction booklet and a few video links how to do it. I had done this already before I even contacted Sunny CS, but the belt kept moving off center. After a 2 week email exchange with Sunny CS I took the pains to ask Amazon for an exchange. I am NOT happy that I now have to re-pack a 150 lbs equipment to have it shipped back, but I was not willing to accept that I have to live with a mal-functioning belt either.
I will update how the new one works, and hopefully I can upgrade my star rating. So far it was a big disappointment. It also came with a cracked cover that houses the motor and electrical equipment. But that was minor, and Amazon gracefully offered to exchange or a discount. I took the discount to avoid exchanging. Now I still have to put up with disassembling and repacking that treadmill"
I hesitated buying this out of fear that it would be a waste of money due to product quality. I actually ordered it, cancelled the order and reordered it with a lot of doubts while waiting for it to arrive. I received it yesterday. The setup was easy but my initial thoughts were that the treadmill was very narrow. After doing my first 40 minute walk/jog today I'm pleased to say that it wasn't an issue at all. Folding it up is so simple and the manual incline settings are easy to do as well. I will update this review in the future for people who are looking for more than just the initial review.
"Pro's: Price and Storability
Con's: The narrow base makes harder to run on, especially when you really get going, and when you hit the stop button it slows down nicely then it before abruptly stops.
If you want a treadmill primarily for walking this is not a bad option; if your a runner, or want to do interval training on it, I would get one with a larger wider and more stable base. I'm 55 going on 56 so I'm not much of a runner anymore, but when I do increase the speed the base seems to bounce a lot more then it should for a guy that only weighs 165 pounds."
"I got this treadmill a few days ago and I love it. I am a 66 year old woman. Aside from getting the machine up the stairs (thanks to my grandsons for that), the hardest part of assembly was getting it out of the box and all the packing materials. It took me (alone) just a few minutes to attach and tighten the screws, apply the oil under the belt, and it was ready to go. It is so easy to fold and unfold, thanks to its relatively lower weight and slow release feature. No more struggling to lift the platform and risk injury to myself or damage to my floor. It does not have a lot of bells and whistles, but I never used them on my old, more expensive machine. It is a few inches narrower than I'm used to, but this forces me to keep my arms bent (rather than hanging at my side) and my stride straight, so it's an advantage. It is somewhat quieter than other models I've had, although I still have to turn up the tv volume. I like having the on/off and speed controls on the handle bars. So far, it is a great purchase.
4/23/2020 Update. After well over 2 years of fairly regular use (including over 10,000 steps a day during COVID-19 stay-at-home) I still love this treadmill. It works like new and I would definitely recommended it. Great product."
I've been using this for about 30 minutes a day since it arrived. Its easy to use and the display is nice and legible. Oiling up the track was a cinch and for the price this is an excellent purchase. Now just a couple of cons. The cup holder is angled and my sports drinks bounce out of it when I run and its too small for other bottles I have so I have to stop when I want water but not a biggie since you can pause your workout so you don't lose your stats. If you accidentally pull off the safety pin it will zero out all your stats which is a bummer if you had a goal time or distance. Lastly, the handles that check your pulse are too low. I'm 5'9 and have to slouch a little so b its uncomfortable for me to use that function. All in all I think if you're a beginner this will be perfect. If you don't have much strength you might need assistance taking it out if the box. My little bird arms struggled!
I purchased this item as a family present so we could all stay in shape during the quarantine. It is very simple to assemble and incredibly easy to move. As far as using it to work out I would say it wasn't worth it for me. I am 6'3 and this treadmill is tiny. At best I can walk on it. If i try and run it feels like the thing is going to fall apart. However, my mother and brother use it and they are around 5'4 and 5'9 in height, and they have a much easier time using it. In conclusion I would say it's a great item as long as your not a giant. It's great for the average height person but if you go over 5'10 you're going to struggle.
So I wanted an affordable treadmill to be able to just walk indoors throughout the winter due to covid. The box was heavy about 120 lbs I think, but I was able to scoot it inside to the area I wanted it. Then I waited a few days to put it together because the thought of it was daunting. 3 days later I got out the instructions and wow! It was so easy! It literally is just inserting a few screws and tightening them. Not bad at all! I was so relieved! I would recommend this hands down because it is so easy to get up and running. Quality is good for the price too.
I haven't had the treadmill long, but so far, it's meeting my expectations. I've had several good workouts on it and so has my teenage son. It's a very basic model but it does the job. Assembly was easy enough. It inhabits the same location. Even though some of the pictures in the ad make it look like you can wheel it around your home depending on where you want to work out, that part of it seems misrepresented...it's not at all easy to wheel around but I have a designated space for it and that works. There are some features I wish it had but also knew I was paying for something pretty basic. It's nice to have especially now during the pandemic and for rainier weather when going outside just isn't feasible.
Just received today, I used it an my wife used it . So far it's exactly like described . Wasn't bad to assemble , a few screws that's basically it. Oil it up with the small amount of oil they give you , from recommendations of how often you should oil it I would recommend purchasing a larger tube of oil. Other then that runs smooth , fairly quiet not loud you will hear your feet running or walking over the machine . Will see how it goes an I will update this after a month if anything changes . So far I am happy about works very well. UPDATE: still very happy with machine just a few quirks Very minor quirks I will point out ,iPad doesn't fit on the holder completely , incline seems very very minor almost like no incline, I do have mine set up on carpeting so not sure if that makes a difference with the machine sinking in a bit again for the price well worth it. I have had it over a week now an it's used everyday my wife an I and two older kids an so far no issues will update In a month or if any issues come about .
Nice treadmill for a great price. However it's much smaller and more narrow then a normal treadmill. Now I'm a female and I'm tiny I am 4ft 11in and weigh 100lbs. It's works great for me but may not be so great for a larger person whom also weighs more. It also doesn't really have a good incline if that's what your looking for. I do high intensity workouts so I'm only running no more then 400 meters to a half mile at a time so it works perfect for me. If your just doing running workouts it may not be great tho. The stand is nice too for your tablet however if you have a regular size iPad you can only use it the long way. If you have a smaller tablet such as an iPad mini you can lay it either way. Since I'm not on the treadmill for long periods of time I don't use that function anyway but for those who like to watch something while using it may want to know that.
Super easy to set up. It is the perfect size for my tiny living room. I put the oil on it before using and so far, have not had any problems. It is much smaller than what we are used to (we're used to the enormous ones in the gyms) but after a week or so, we have adapted and is not a problem at all. The only thing we don't like is there is an off button on the L handle bar. It's bad placement. Too easy to stop. I have accidently hit it too many times already. Rest is great. As for the noise level, I think it is average. Same to me as any other treadmill I have ever been on in my life. So far, I would recommend this treadmill. It is a no frills treadmill that does the job. I use it for training so I don't need to have any progams. I set my own pace. Also, one of the main reasons I got this aside from the size, is the fact that I don't have to sign up for anything. Just plug it in, turn it on, and go.
I'm so glad I got this treadmill. Two guys delivered it from Amazon in a large truck. It took two people to get it upstairs to the room where I wanted it. It took 45 min for my sister and I to install. Installation was pretty easy though the instructions could have been clearer. The most difficult part of install was lubricating the track. Initially, I could still feel the track sticking slightly at low speeds. I have since re-lubricated and now have no issue. Overall, I am very pleased. It is a great, basic treadmill. I have used it almost everyday since receiving it. I would recommend getting a mat to place underneath the treadmill. It is on the third floor of my small-ish house but you can hear it in the basement when it is in use, especially when running at high speeds.
It was fairly easy to assembly it and move it to where I wanted it. Works nice for a jog or walk. I didn't feel any slip from the belt. So far it's what I wanted for jogging. However, it arrived with damage that was under the packaging material so that means they actually sent it this way knowing there was a huge scratch. That's not the type of company I really want to buy products from. Also, wheeling it is a bit cumbersome. the anchor legs with wheels are long so it's like you are wheeling a gurney. Also it has a hydraulic type tube to hold the treadmill up when folded. It does not have a safety lock to hold it in place so I will place a bungie cord around it to keep it safe. For the price it works for what I need it for but when I replace it I will buy from another company that does not send damaged products.
I wish it was a little smaller. It's easy to assemble and easy to raise and lower. It works well and I like walking on it. It has a place to put your phone or i-pad or a book. It has two cup holders and itholds my large Yeti cup. It's a great little treadmill. The one thing I didn't like when putting it together was trying to apply the lubrication to the underside of the treadmill belt that you walk on. It was hard getting my hand underneath the belt, and it wasn't clear as how much lubricant to use.
Easy setup and conveniently fit into a smaller space. Before purchasing I read reviews about this being too narrow. I've used it for walking, jogging, running, and sprinting workouts and it is fantastic! Easy access buttons on the sides are very convenient, gorgeous display, and the folding up/down is smooth/simple. Didn't have high expectations with the price, and purchased this with the intent of keeping it outdoors (with a cover), but pleasantly surprised with the quality and durability 1 month in. The HR monitor is nowhere near accurate, but again, for the price, I wasn't purchasing a treadmill to give me an accurate HR reading. This is the second piece of cardio equipment purchased from SUNNY Health and Fitness. Highly recommend the brand. Our spin bike has lasted over 10 years, and the customer service from Sunny is unparalleled.
"Power not working. Just taken out of the box.
Treadmill box (super heavy!) arrived with no dents. Parts were nice and not scratched. Took about 30 min to assemble.
Plugged it in to give it a try and it doesn't work. The main power is on but the display panel is not so neither the belt nor I can run."
I received this treadmill today. The box was slightly damaged, but the treadmill seemed to be fine cosmetically. It was easy to put together, and I followed the instructions that said to lubricate the belt. Once I turned it on, the motor was unbelievably loud. I live in an apartment, and the level of noise this treadmill made was unacceptable. In addition to the sound of the belt moving, there was a constant chirping, a slower thumping, and a separate much faster thumping that increased as the speed increased. This was all happening without me being on it. It sounded exactly like my washing machine/dryer. I'm returning it immediately.
Great item. Neat packaging, straight forward assembly instructions. (Only a few bolts to screw in) easy set up, Easy to fold, and easy to move around. Sturdy and compact. Perfect for my limited space in an apartment.
The product is good for the price. I am 5'4, 137 lb and my husband 5'7 and 163 lb. We just needed something simple to run on nothing too fancy. The machine was easy to assemble and the delivery was good. My only complaint is the machine is a little loud, I do worry maybe it won't last super long. I say that because it's not just the tread that is loud. It's making a weird mechanical noise when you go fast. The arms also shake when you run, and we don't even weigh that much. The incline is VERY slight even at its highest. These are my reason for a four star. Overall I am happy I purchased this treadmill, it's been serving it's purpose. I hope that customer service will help if the treadmill does have a defect causing the noise when running. We shall see. It's only been a week of daily use.
Looking for a decent treadmill and gave myself a $400 max limit. After reading all the reviews and looking for a smaller treadmill and one that could be folded, I decided on this one. My husband put it together, he's a whiz at assembling, and he had no issues. One of the round feet broke off in shipping, however he was able to put another screw in and attached the foot. The only thing I will say is the box arrived in awful condition. I was afraid to look inside as there were many large holes in box. Thumbs up for the amount of styrofoam and packing around the treadmill. It's quiet and belt is a good size for person to use without feeling like you are going to slide right off the back. I have done some light running and have had no problem with that either. Certainly I would recommend this model. Also arrived in a surprisingly timely manner. Great job UPS but not so great on condition of box.
After reading so many reviews, I bought it! It's great! It works really well, easy setup, get a friend to help you carry it if you have to move it far. Didn't require a mat. Use it on the second floor in the room next to where my boys sleep. Daily use and still no worries! Highly recommend! One feature for these folks for a future modification - would be nice to have a pause button, but I just notch the speed down to .5mph if I need to grab more water or something and then can easily get back on. I set it up facing a bookshelf and set my compy on some books to right height so I can watch and run! Here's hoping for longevity but so far a couple of months in and it's roses!
"I'm 5'7"" weigh 165 lb. After one and a half month use (40min a day) the treadmill developed a pop sound each time my right foot hit the belt during running. I shot a video and submitted a ticket. The ticket said waiting for 5-10 days for response. Five days later I got an email questioning the right side of treadmill might be uneven. I pulled the treadmill to a more even place but the noise was still there. I shot another video and sent to the customer support. The next day I got a reply asking me to check any possible damage on the bottom of the treadmill. There's no visible damage, so I sent more video/photos to show my observation, and told them we need to figure this out soon because the return/replace window almost ends. To my surprise, the company opened another ticket on behalf of me without closing the current one, saying I need to wait for 7-14 days to get response. Obviously this company is trying to make the return/replace window closed before they draw any conclusion. Today is the 7th day, but I believe they won't get back to me till the 14th day. What a company and how sly the customer support is! I will update my review if something changes.
UPDATE:
The company never contact me with these two tickets still open. I re-read the email with the ticket information. The first email says 5-10 business days (make sense for one to two working weeks), but the second email says 7-14 business days (for a little over one week and a little less than three weeks?). Obviously they put the numbers intentionally to just pass my return window. I am so sick about this company playing tricks here and there."
"The first shipment came damaged, the motor cover is plastic and it was cracked in several spots upon inspection there was no point in assembling it at that point. Amazon customer service was fantastic, immediately shipped a new one and even arranged a courier pick up to return the damaged one.
The new one arrived as promised and was super easy to assemble. The only down side is that many parts of the treadmill are made of cheap plastic so will need to be gentile on it as I can see the plastic motor cover or the plastic console pieces cracking if your are careful with it. I wish they would make it a bit sturdier not with flimsy unreinforced cheap plastic. But I suppose as this price point you get what you pay for. Overall its a decent treadmill if you are just looking for short term cheap treadmill for light to medium use."
"when this treadmill came in the mail, i was ecstatic. the assembly was easy, it's a great size, and the specs say it can go up to 9mph. i have been running for about two years consistently now, averaging about 40 miles per month and around an 8:00 mile so this treadmill was perfect.
the problem is that - and at first i thought i was imagining it - after having this treadmill for about a month and logging almost 50 miles, i know for a fact that this motor does not keep an even speed, especially at higher speeds. it constantly glitches and quick slows down for a second, then speeds back up to the desired speed. and it does this constantly when running at higher speeds. my opinion is that this product, and maybe just mine and my own experience, is defective and DANGEROUS."
We used the product for 2 months and it started giving Weird Noise after that. Maintained it as per their instructions only. Whenever you try their support number (877) 90-SUNNY always lands on recorded message, could never talk to a Customer Service Representative. Only one email response, which didn't solve the problem. It has been 3 weeks since we opened the support (ticket is 60217007).
Great product at great..... Unfortunately they are just not built to last. My tread mill has so far been great but it has started to make some very concerning noises....
This treadmill is worth the money. I've had it for a month and a half and use it five to seven days a week. It's still going strong. It is quiet-ish. I keep it in the living room and walk on it while watching Netflix. I do have to turn up the TV and turn on closed captioning. I wouldn't say this is any louder than a treadmill that I was on in the gym. I love being able to work out when I want to at home. easy to fold up and easy to unfold. Takes a bit of doing to move it around on the carpet. I figured out how to walk it, my husband pushes it on the wheels. My only complaints would be the cup holders same a bit shallow and The hand hold side bars are narrow. I consistently knock my wrists on the ends. So I either have to have my elbows bent/hands up in a jogging position or have to walk further back on the belt. Neither the shallow cup holders nor the narrow sidebars are a deal breaker.
"I did about a month's research before I placed my order for the Sunny Treadmill. I needed something that folded up (since I live in an apartment), needed something small, and wanted a machine that wasn't too loud. This hits all the points I needed. It doesn't take up too much space. I can easily move it around to use every day, and then move back in it's spot when not being used. It is lighter than other treadmills I have owned.
It's compact and has an appealing look to it. It's not an eyesore. I am a smaller woman, so something that I could move was paramount. The assembly was super quick. It took longer to take all the wrappings off the machine than the actual assembly. It is very well packed. Set up is just using a couple screws and then applying the oil.
I really loved this purchase and recommend it to everyone who is serious about getting a treadmill in their home. I honestly don't think you will be upset with it."
Great for at home work outs. It's not to big. Plus it's easy to fold and doesn't take up a lot of space once folded. Its not a loud machine but I would recommend some type of mat or foam squares if you have hardwood floors. My husband found the assembly process not to bad. He had some trouble with getting the belt lined up. I would also recommend that you oil the bet really really well during assembly to avoid having to do so during your work out. If you're using your phone or tablet on the shelf in front of the display screen; be prepared to consistently move it to see the display screen. There is no cool down mode. You'll have to do that manually.
I tend to pour over reviews and was nervous about the 1 and 2 stars, but I took the plunge and am SO glad I did! This was super easy setup, only needed to install 10 screws and took 15 minutes from the time we scooted the box into the room I told I was up and running! I was concerned about the length of the mat because I'm 5'10 and have a long stride, but I have no problem walking and jogging with my normal stride. I love the controls on the handles and the present programs. Perfect for what I need! So far so good and I would buy this again and again!
"I'd say that the only thing I wasn't 100% aware of was the changes in inclination. It isn't automated, and requires you to take off 2 screws, lift up the machine to the desired inclination, and put the screw in. For myself personally (I am a slightly heavy-set guy, come on I bought this for a reason) I can do it myself with little to no issue, but for someone like my mom, a bit older, not heavy set at all, it's a bit of a struggle for her. Also I believe there is only 3 inclination levels, so don't expect much diversity in that regard.
With that being said, at this price point, in this range, the thing works BEAUTIFULLY! No issues, we've been working it almost non-stop for a couple months now and we don't even see the slightest bit of wear and tear. We expect this to last us a bare minimum of 2 years, and possibly last as long as 15 years, so when you think of it like that, it ends up costing you, what? $20 a year? $1.75 a month?
Solid product, the build quality is good, just remember to lube up the track every once in a while (because of our heavy use we are putting a bit of lube on it every month or so, but we don't exactly expect everyone to have 5 different people use it consistently/daily). Highly recommend it."
It's been a month and the machine seems to work fine but there's one major defect that's restricting it's ability to be folded properly. See the photos attached, it shows how the center console is not vertical in exact 90 degree angle. It's tilted to the right and due to which the when the floor is folded it hits and rubs against the right side handle. The only reason I am not returning it is because it's too much work and the defect doesn't seem to prevent it's main operation for now. But it causes any further issues I will be returning it for sure. And I don't recommend this product. If you can, invest in a better brand with a better quality product.
"Before I bought this treadmill I read most of the reviews. Generally I throw out most of the 5's and 1's.
I decided to order. It arrived a day earlier than promised. It was a bit heavy to get in the door and in place. (I'm 80 year old male) Unboxed it. Was in good condition. Well packed. Took about an hour to put together - rather easy to do. Directions were pretty good. Try to walk on it everyday.
The reason I did not rate it 5: (1) On off switch on the floor, hard to get at in our crowded space. I have since learned that I can leave it on when finished, pull the magnet off, and after awhile the electronics turn off. Put the magnet back in and push the ""start"" button and it starts rolling. (2) I'm 6'. I need to hold or touch handles in order to stay balanced. Handles are a little low - have to bend shoulders a bit and after a few minutes my right shoulder begins to ache. I'm going to try to fix that. Not sure how, but think I will had something to handles that will let me ""hold"" on a little higher.
I didn't buy the long term warranty. May be a mistake.
For now, very well pleased with the purchase. My ""complaints"" are minor. Will try to update after 2-3 months."
I only needed a treadmill for light walking (around 3 mph) and the treadmill is good for that and they display and controls are very easy to read and comfortable to use. I like the hand rails because my balance is not good. The only thing I do not like about this treadmill is that it is a little bit tricky to fold the belt down and that when you fold it up, it does not fold to a 90 degree angle so it takes up more space than if it did.
"We have had this treadmill for less than a week. My husband & I have both used it a couple of times. It is perfect for our needs. It is wide & long enough to use without any problems with room. It's easy to operate. It comes with 3 speed buttons 2/4/6 mph, plus you can manually adjust the speeds with +/- buttons. It has 2 cup holders that will fit a standard size cup/bottle. My bottle is larger than your average bottle (it holds 32 oz) & did not fit in the cup holder. It does not have a separate tablet/smartphone holder, but there is a place to set it, it just obstructs view of the display. Which, can be a good thing if you're like me & constantly staring at the numbers wondering how much longer you have to go LOL.
We did receive the unit with a crack in the motor top cover. We requested a replacement for just that one part since we already went ahead & put it together thinking we could just replace the part. However, Amazon could not replace the part alone & the manufacturer did not answer the phone. We did not want to take it apart & go thru the hassle of repackaging & returning so we settled for a partial refund. It's more of a cosmetic issue than anything so it has no impact on the performance of the treadmill.
I am happy with it. I am very happy to be able to have a treadmill to use at home."
This is my third treadmill. I like it very much. It is easy to install and use. Its function is almost the same as the treadmill I used in the gym. I can walk slowly, and then start running slowly. Now I can enjoy fitness at home. The only regret is that it is too small. All in all, this is exactly what I want in the price range I want. If you are looking for every button in the sun, adjustable inclination, etc. on a treadmill like a gym, then it is definitely not the treadmill you want. If you are looking for a compact fitness machine to maintain your exercise without taking up too much space in your life or home, then this is a good choice.
This is a great little treadmill for the price! After reading all of the reviews I was a little hesitant, but because of the price I decided to take a chance and I'm glad that I did. It arrived sooner than I expected and was easy to assemble. I usually walk outside unless weather is really bad, so I just wanted something to get me through the really cold days. I just walk 2.5-3mph, 4 days a week for an hour, I'm over 50 about 5.4, 138llbs (it may be a bit small for my husband). It has been perfect for me, not big, heavy and bulky. Very simple, you do not have to join anything, I do not use the programs. It comes with oil for belt, but after reading reviews I did purchase an extra oil in different container which was fine. However I don't think it was necessary, the oil that comes with it would probably be OK too (maybe more difficult to apply because of container, but really not a big deal). I do have to say the iPad holder is too small for my iPad, but I have made it work. I am very happy with this purchase!
"If you are looking to do your daily cardio and don't want too much money, this is it. I assembled it myself, nothing complicated at all. The dashboard is simple and easy to understand without reading the manual and the machine is safe and sturdy. Super easy to fold and move around. I use it while watching TV in the living room and store it in my guest room. The only downside is that the incline options have to be changed manually, to me not a big deal.
I was concerned and a little doubtful when I read negative reviews but my experience with machine has been nothing like that. Obviously if you are looking for advanced hard core, marathon type of workout go buy the top notch machine. This is for an average person that is looking to do regular walk/sprint work outs. I use it with an app I downloaded for free on the side: TREADMILL WORKOUT."
I was excited about this item ...I have received this item relatively fast, the box had damages but the overall state of the treadmill was fine. I put the treadmill together and started a smooth run on it for about 10 min and I felt the belt coming off shifting left!! I was like what the heck?? so I read the instruction and adjusted the both the right and left bot as indicated and I could reset the belt to the center. I tried to run again and after 10 min the belt is coming off again!! I was disappointed with this purchase! I DON't recommend.
My wife and I want a treadmill to walk on and this product certainly serves that purpose easily. The assembly is very easy involving the placement of several screws with washers to lock the unit into place. The most difficult part was moving the 100 pound box. I did it by myself but would recommend a second person to make this much more easy. The oiling of the treadmill belt was made easier when I reviewed several videos. I used an option that was not in the instructions to loosen the tread track first. I did a total of 10 counter clockwise adjustments on each adjustment screw 5 turns at a time, and then retighted with clockwise adjustments after oiling. There was no issue with belt alignment. The operation of the unit is very similar to the much more expensive units. It does not have an automatic incline adjustment, but has 3 mechanical positions. This was not an issue for either of us, but if you are looking for automatic incline, this could be an issue for you. The price, options, performance was spot on for us. If we find any issues as we use it, I will update my review.
Love it! Easy instructions and I was able to set up with ease. I am 5ft 2 in and 125 lb and was able to move on wheels without help.Perfect for working moms trying to get in better shape for the new year after gaining weight in 2020 ðŸ˜·.
Due to the pandemic I've avoided the gym and began running outdoors. I bought this treadmill so I can still run during the freezing cold Iowa winters. It's a fantastic option for that. I run about 3-4 miles per day and it works just fine. The area for running isn't that wide but most of the time it's not an issue because I have a short/narrow stride.
"Re-writing the review (improved from 3 to 5 stars):
Sunny Health & Fitness has great customer service. I bought 2 of these (one for me and another for my mother), first one came with some manufacturer problems, upon letting know the manufacturer about this they were immediately at a helping disposition.
the 2nd treadmill arrived damaged (likely from S&H). manufacturer again immediately responded and provided me with a replacement cover (the damaged part). based on both treadmill quality and their customer service, I highly recommend this device"
I was one of the lucky ones that received a perfect treadmill with no issues. I'm a petite female and was able to put it together myself in under :30 minutes, you just need a helper (my 7 year old) to hold the bar for a bit while you tighten the screw. Works great and I am able to work out on it for a long time, my longest run so far has been 2 hours and 15 minutes. (The timer starts over at 99:99 but I use a Garmin to track my time) I am training for a half marathon and marathon and this helps for those times I cannot get out or if it is too late/dark. Its a perfect size for me at 5'3". The only thing that needs getting used to is the pace is in MPH and not minutes and I am not used to that but its not a big deal. It is compact and fits nicely in the corner of my living room. This is a game changer for me to be able supplement my outdoor training without the high cost or bulk. Overall it was worth it and the price was fantastic for what I am getting out of it.
"It started out great! Was super pleased with the purchase even though the unit had arrived with the plastic pieces broken and we had to jump through hoops to get replacements.
We've had this for a year when it started dragging then speeding up. Figured out it was likely the brushes in the motor that needed replacing....who knew you needed to do that? It seemed like a simple fix based on videos we viewed, but we realized quickly that the motor in this unit seemed to be designed to not give easy access to the brushes for replacement. A new motor would be almost as much as a new treadmill. Not happy for only a years worth of usage from this. It was only used for about 30 minutes a day at most."
I bought this treadmill on March 4th 2020 and started giving problems the beginning of August, this morning August 14th it completely stopped working. Called Amazon and they guided me through a "Trouble Shoot" process and it was determined that the motor has failed. Amazon then offered to replace with a new unit and return the old to them. I will be ding this. All I have to say is Amazon is the "BEST" and am so appreciative of the way they resolve problems especially with this expensive product
I'm so disappointed about this treadmill I had to return it, after 3 use the belt was keep shifting due to belt defective I fell & hurt myself I won't recommend it to anyone & don't waste your time & money .
The price was great and this unit is exceptionally quiet. I am a male senior citizen and I have no need for a super duper treadmill. It will work for most people who want to decent workout but don't want or need to run at high speeds. It is also easy to operate.
Product arrived much sooner than promised. Unfortunately had one plastic part that was cracked in shipping. I'm not taking off any stars for it because I was so impressed the Ashley at Customer Service. When I called they answered on the 1st ring. I almost fell over. She was very helpful and said no problem to replace the broken part. Users manual was very easy to read and understand and all the parts were marked and named. The treadmill was easy to use and very quiet. I had only used to a large heavy treadmill from the gym and my old home gym. I knew I did not want anything that large or had stuff on it I would never use. If you want an easy to use, basic treadmill - the SF-T4400 is perfect. Just right for this 71 year old 175# lady. I took my husband about 90 minutes to put it together, test, lubricate, and adjust the belt. Good instructions included.
I turned to this treadmill when our Governor decided to close gyms for the second time. I am not good at assembling things, so I was skeptical of the claims it would be easy. I was also skeptical if, for the price, I would be able to do my usual workout (6.0 miles per hour for 60 minutes) ... but so far this treadmill has been great! It was easy to assemble (I did need help carrying it in the house and down to the basement ... it is a little heavy) ... but other than that I set it up quickly by myself and was ready to go.
This machine was great for about 2 months. It was at two months it began to run slower and slower until it was obvious that the MPH couldn't be trusted and it was malfunctioning. After turning it off completely, I left it alone for the day. The next day it wouldn't come on at all. Absolute junk. I was very disappointed. I bought the machine to walk as part of a vital therapy program due to a health concern. Thank goodness I had purchased the insurance. The full amount was refunded back to my form of payment and I ordered...A DIFFERENT BRAND! I like it much better.
Overall great treadmill. I am 200 lbs male it's a bit narrow and when I run fast it's the most steady. I love the start and stop buttons and fast slower buttons on the handles and the shelf to hold your phone is great as well. I recommend this to many others looking for a affordable solid treadmill.
I finally decided to order a treadmill after reading what seemed like hundreds of reviews, I chose this one. Sadly, it couldn't be delivered to me, so I had it delivered to a friend 40 miles away. The set up was pretty easy (once I took a deep breath and didn't let the schematics get the best of me ðŸ˜‰) I used it today, and so far LOVE it... I'll update if needed!
This treadmill works very well. I've had other ones previous to this one and they were bigger and bulkier and hard to move around. I was hesitant to buy this one because of the low price but I am very pleased and pleasantly surprised. There was not much to assemble - just a few bolts and the lubrication of the belt - in 15 minutes it was up and running. I did check to see if it was damaged when it arrived because most of the bad reviews were about that. But the box was intact. The treadmill has a lot of features and I've been using it for a few days now and I really like it. Yes, it is a bit narrower than the big ones but I can walk on it comfortably. That's what I mostly do. But I could probably run on it fine. So if you feel you need a lot of width, you might look into a bigger one. But then you're getting into bigger, heavier, and bulkier. The length of the belt is fine - I feel I have a lot of room to take big steps. Overall, I'm really happy with this treadmill.
Amazing treadmill for the price! I run pretty much everyday. I'm a marathon and ultra marathon runner and got this treadmill for times when weather is bad or just too late to run. I've ran up to 11 miles in this treadmill in one go and held up very well. Very impressed.
I saw another reviewers post and a light bulb went off. I happened to have a backing from an old tv console so I cut it in half glued it and there it is. I'm working from home and needed to get up and move. Bonus, fits right next to the tellie! Arrived in perfect condition. It's pretty heavy. It's not flimsy garbage, it's quite substantial. Easy to assemble, took about 15 mins. because I had to read the instructions first. It's well packaged and that took more time then actually assembling it. I expected it to be loud because of some of the reviews I read, it's not at all. It's like any other treadmill motor, no different. I wasn't sure which Sunny model to get so I went with the lower priced one, it's great. Time will only tell if I actually did make a good decision, at present, I'm happy. If you're on the fence, get it.
It is really easy to assemble. Straight forward directions and all necessary pieces included. No surprises. It was a little tricky to lubricate but we loosened the belt and then tightened it again - it was the only way to get the oil onto the track under the belt. It fits perfectly in our basement - which has a low ceiling so thankfully my husband who is 5'11 can comfortably use it and still have clearance from the ceiling. Hardest part was carrying it from the porch to the basement - it's heavy! But totally worth it. It's great having a gym-quality piece of equipment at home. Be sure to read directions about how to use the pre-programmed options. And I'll have to set a calendar reminder to lubricate the track (I imagine that's easy to forget until it's too late).
The quality of the machine is good, but customer service is bad. Bad customer service. I purchased a treadmill. About 2 years ago, after the year of warranty, my dog ate a cable. I reached to Sunny health and fitness during the pandemic to see if I can fix the machine. Weeks went by and no help. I understood that most likely they were not working. I continue to send emails and a response how to restart. Did not work, I wrote emails and received a cable that who ever was helping then was kind. I was grateful for that. In the email said that they were sending me a cable, but if it does not work, they would send me the console. However since that email, weeks has pass by and no answer at all. I think if they can not help, at least say it, but I think what ever you say you are going to do it, you must honor it.
You can't beat the value! My petite wife and I were able to carry the unpackaged treadmill down a staircase into our basement with no trouble. Just be sure the stronger person carries the heavy end. I weigh around 165lbs and have been running on it daily at speeds up to 8.5mph. No issues at all. Be sure to adjust the belt per the owner's manual and give it a good initial lubrication. You can also manually adjust the incline, from 0 - 3 degrees.
Treadmill arrived well packaged. Unless you are a hulk, get somebody to help you move it. It is heavy. My wife and I (I'm 70 years old) slid it to the basement. I read all instructions and checked for all the parts before assembling. Assembly was fairly easy as others have noted. Note you cannot plug this into a GFI outlet so plan ahead. I did have to adjust the actual walking surface to track true. Also, it is a little difficult to get the lubricant under the belt but can be accomplished. Just completed my first walking exercise and am quite pleased, and out of shape. I won't be running on the treadmill. If you are an experienced treadmill runner, this may not be the machine for you. It is narrower than those in the gym. For home walking, I think it is perfect. So far, very pleased. I'll update as I go along. I did spend the extra $40 for a 3 year maintenance contract. Always leery of things built in China for longevity. Hey, it's only 40 bucks. I'll buy one less case of craft beer.
We LOVE this treadmill! It's the perfect size for our space. It's pretty quiet so I can workout while others are working in the same room. My daughter runs about two miles on it every morning. I walk 10-30 minutes at a time, multiple times throughout the day, everyday. This unit was so easy to put together. It only took me 15-20 minutes after unpacking it. We have had it for a week now and it's running smoothly with no hiccups so far. I highly recommend this treadmill for moderately serious workouts. I don't think it would hold up to avid runners and such, but it's excellent for those who desire to stay healthy and active.
Overall great treadmill. I am 200 lbs male it's a bit narrow and when I run fast it's the most steady. I love the start and stop buttons and fast slower buttons on the handles and the shelf to hold your phone is great as well. I recommend this to many others looking for a affordable solid treadmill.
I finally decided to order a treadmill after reading what seemed like hundreds of reviews, I chose this one. Sadly, it couldn't be delivered to me, so I had it delivered to a friend 40 miles away. The set up was pretty easy (once I took a deep breath and didn't let the schematics get the best of me ðŸ˜‰) I used it today, and so far LOVE it... I'll update if needed!
This treadmill works very well. I've had other ones previous to this one and they were bigger and bulkier and hard to move around. I was hesitant to buy this one because of the low price but I am very pleased and pleasantly surprised. There was not much to assemble - just a few bolts and the lubrication of the belt - in 15 minutes it was up and running. I did check to see if it was damaged when it arrived because most of the bad reviews were about that. But the box was intact. The treadmill has a lot of features and I've been using it for a few days now and I really like it. Yes, it is a bit narrower than the big ones but I can walk on it comfortably. That's what I mostly do. But I could probably run on it fine. So if you feel you need a lot of width, you might look into a bigger one. But then you're getting into bigger, heavier, and bulkier. The length of the belt is fine - I feel I have a lot of room to take big steps. Overall, I'm really happy with this treadmill.
Amazing treadmill for the price! I run pretty much everyday. I'm a marathon and ultra marathon runner and got this treadmill for times when weather is bad or just too late to run. I've ran up to 11 miles in this treadmill in one go and held up very well. Very impressed.
I saw another reviewers post and a light bulb went off. I happened to have a backing from an old tv console so I cut it in half glued it and there it is. I'm working from home and needed to get up and move. Bonus, fits right next to the tellie! Arrived in perfect condition. It's pretty heavy. It's not flimsy garbage, it's quite substantial. Easy to assemble, took about 15 mins. because I had to read the instructions first. It's well packaged and that took more time then actually assembling it. I expected it to be loud because of some of the reviews I read, it's not at all. It's like any other treadmill motor, no different. I wasn't sure which Sunny model to get so I went with the lower priced one, it's great. Time will only tell if I actually did make a good decision, at present, I'm happy. If you're on the fence, get it.
It is really easy to assemble. Straight forward directions and all necessary pieces included. No surprises. It was a little tricky to lubricate but we loosened the belt and then tightened it again - it was the only way to get the oil onto the track under the belt. It fits perfectly in our basement - which has a low ceiling so thankfully my husband who is 5'11 can comfortably use it and still have clearance from the ceiling. Hardest part was carrying it from the porch to the basement - it's heavy! But totally worth it. It's great having a gym-quality piece of equipment at home. Be sure to read directions about how to use the pre-programmed options. And I'll have to set a calendar reminder to lubricate the track (I imagine that's easy to forget until it's too late).
The quality of the machine is good, but customer service is bad. Bad customer service. I purchased a treadmill. About 2 years ago, after the year of warranty, my dog ate a cable. I reached to Sunny health and fitness during the pandemic to see if I can fix the machine. Weeks went by and no help. I understood that most likely they were not working. I continue to send emails and a response how to restart. Did not work, I wrote emails and received a cable that who ever was helping then was kind. I was grateful for that. In the email said that they were sending me a cable, but if it does not work, they would send me the console. However since that email, weeks has pass by and no answer at all. I think if they can not help, at least say it, but I think what ever you say you are going to do it, you must honor it.
You can't beat the value! My petite wife and I were able to carry the unpackaged treadmill down a staircase into our basement with no trouble. Just be sure the stronger person carries the heavy end. I weigh around 165lbs and have been running on it daily at speeds up to 8.5mph. No issues at all. Be sure to adjust the belt per the owner's manual and give it a good initial lubrication. You can also manually adjust the incline, from 0 - 3 degrees.
Treadmill arrived well packaged. Unless you are a hulk, get somebody to help you move it. It is heavy. My wife and I (I'm 70 years old) slid it to the basement. I read all instructions and checked for all the parts before assembling. Assembly was fairly easy as others have noted. Note you cannot plug this into a GFI outlet so plan ahead. I did have to adjust the actual walking surface to track true. Also, it is a little difficult to get the lubricant under the belt but can be accomplished. Just completed my first walking exercise and am quite pleased, and out of shape. I won't be running on the treadmill. If you are an experienced treadmill runner, this may not be the machine for you. It is narrower than those in the gym. For home walking, I think it is perfect. So far, very pleased. I'll update as I go along. I did spend the extra $40 for a 3 year maintenance contract. Always leery of things built in China for longevity. Hey, it's only 40 bucks. I'll buy one less case of craft beer.
We LOVE this treadmill! It's the perfect size for our space. It's pretty quiet so I can workout while others are working in the same room. My daughter runs about two miles on it every morning.

I don't think it would hold up to avid runners and such, but it's excellent for those who desire to stay healthy and active.
I ordered this treadmill after my cousin in Chicago got one and loves hers. I was able to use our stimulus check to purchase it. It took weeks to arrive and then had a motor issue. I was impatient and very discouraged having waited so long only now to not be able to use it. Long story short, SunnyHealthFitness was very patient with me doing the best they could under these difficult times, helped me resolve the issue with the motor and now I have a great running treadmill that I will recommend to anyone!
"It is definitely not for small spaces.
The incline is mediocre.
The pre programs exercises are only 10 minutes long each which is annoying because I'm going up and down up and down in speed from 1.8 to 5. I like to speed walk and jog/run for 40min a day. So I have to do 4 different programs for a full work out. Not a huge deal but its annoying how it brings me down to 1.8 at 10min in when I would want to be around 4. I have had a tread mill that did 30min workouts. I enjoyed that. It pushed me to work harder.
That treadmill was about 180 pre covid. I paid about 400 bucks for this one and it's not worth it. However I have already had to exchange bc the first one came damaged. I couldn't find anything much cheaper with an incline and electric. And I won't have my husband lug it down or up the stairs again to help me return and find a better deal."
This is a great treadmill for the price. It doesn't have some of the fancier features of the expensive ones, but it has 9 programs, is easy to assemble and to fold and works great. The packaging was very sturdy with things in place to prevent it from being damaged during transit. I enjoy using it. The buttons on the hand grips are very convenient. It doesn't incline a whole lot, but I can definitely tell the difference when I use the incline it does have.
I ordered the assembly with this and they did it so quickly- but I can tell you now, it really is a two person job, and I would have had difficulty doing it myself or even with a friend. Incredibly easy to use, goes faster than I thought it would, feels sturdy and I've used it twice. I put it near my couch close to my tv so if I watch something, I can at least be active, but it doesn't get in the way if I want to sit on my couch instead. The control buttons on the handles are a nice feature. It counts down from 3 before starting. I find it a little annoying, but I like the safety feature. I'm still trying to find a way to turn off the button sounds, it beeps every time you press any button (though I haven't put much effort into solving this, yet). I would say get it if you're strongly considering getting a treadmill, I feel like it is a frugal option compared to others and still has great features for the price.
the platform under the belt cracked, a little bit over time and then one day just split apart and started spewing powdery stuff everywhere. my husband and i are of average size and weight. this did not hold up to daily use from 2 people. bought it in June, by Oct 1st it was un-usable. had to ask amazon for a full refund to buy another brand, which they provided with no problem. anyone need spare parts?
Compact treadmill and slim (slimmer then a regular treadmill). Slightly heavy but still manageable for one person to move/slide around. Haven't had long enough to know if this was a good investment... so far it's pretty good for jogging/walking. The handles are somewhat short and since it is slim you can find yourself hitting them if you are walking/jogging and don't keep your arms close to your body. If you are walking or jogging and decide to stop and click the stop button it ends rather abruptly so just be careful. Noise wise- it is as loud as a regular treadmill (maybe slightly louder). Set up was fairly simple as it was mostly all assembled- one of the screws was stripped but there was an extra one in the packaging, so just replaced it. I like that it has 3 incline settings to get a somewhat harder workout in. The iPad/phone/book holder is somewhat thin/small, as well as the water bottle holders (but it's a small treadmill so makes sense). All in all the treadmill is good for a small place and someone that is of small build and good for jogging indoors when the gym is closed or it's crappy weather out, didn't want to spend a lot of money on a treadmill but also didn't want to get a cheap treadmill that may not work, this was a good medium.
This treadmill is good for tall people as long as you are not running. I am 6ft 4in and 200 lbs and it seems to fare well when I walk. As soon as I start even a mild jog, it feels like it's going to fall apart. The width of the running surface is decent, but every so often I can feel my feet hitting the sides. There is a small holder for phones / tablets on the top which is useful. If you have a case on your device, it may not fit. The controls on the arm rest are very convenient and I hardly use the ones on the display board. The manual incline is okay but digs into the mat that I have below the machine. Overall, there are some pros and cons to it, but it is a good for walking at your convenience in the comfort of your home during winter months.
This treadmill is my first one so I did a lot of research before buying. It is very easy to put together and folds up easily. Very easy to use and I have had no issues with it. It is pretty quiet and I can't hear it when I an wearing my ear buds. My negatives is that the width is a bit narrow for me but it works for what I need. It does not fold all the way up and the track sticks out more than I was expecting. And for some reason after using for 3 months it is starting to rock back and forth when walking at speed. I did buy the mat for underneath but it is on carpet so not sure if it's just sunk low enough in my carpet to do this or what. It's just a pet peeve and other wise this is a great buy.
This is a very cheaply made treadmill and a complete waste of time and money. Although it was only $400, feels more like it should be sold for half of that. Hours after I built it, it would not turn on. When I finally got it to turn on, the right side of the belt started to skip. Didn't even get a chance to go above a 1.5mph. Don't waste your money. I'm in the process of returning it but that has also been a hassle. Don't buy this with the mentality that you would be able to return it easily.
The treadmill was delivered in five days and that was appreciated. It was easy to assemble and start up. The display is somewhat faint but might depend on the angle that you are trying to view. Its not a big deal but can be annoying. We've been using it for a few weeks and noticed that there is some squeaking sound coming under the hood. The edge of the belt also appears scuffed. We tried asking Sunny Customer service and also discovered that we need to provide proof of purchase. Its something you cannot do via the regular Amazon account. We're supposed to provide proof of purchase , serial number, home address and photos. All of which appear to be very cumbersome and now making me regret buying this off the website. I should have bought it somewhere in store where it can be returned. I cant do it very easily here. I'm hoping the squeak and the scuff isn't too big a deal. Worried if it breaks down, then what do I do? Its only been a month. Hence the 3 stars
This is exactly what I was looking for -- an inexpensive treadmill for daily use. Good quality build. Be aware, the unit is heavy (over 100 lbs.), and comes as one piece. So you'll need help moving it to its permanent location. The track folds up, but it's not exactly a 90 degree angle, so it still takes space. If you're looking for a transportable unit, or something that fits under your bed, this isn't it. But if you need a reliable treadmill, with a super handy ledge for your cell phone / tablet, then this is perfect. PS- The one downside is the heart rate monitor isn't very reliable, but the elapsed time, distance, mph, and calories all appear to be correct.
"This is a hard review to write. This treadmill was easy to set up and was quiet...... Until just one week later and now there is this really annoying clicking sound. So bummed. I'll keep using it until it totally breaks, then I hope to buy a better one.
***update- it's still running but now it has added a grinding sound along with the clicking. I'm just going to use it until it finally breaks down. Then I'm going to do better research and buy a new one."
The treadmill comes in an approximate 3' x 7' x 1' box and instructions are to open it and lift it out. It is quite heavy particularly on the motor end and lifting it was out of the question so we cut the side of the box open and slide it out. Some of the packing remained on the bottom so we propped the light end up and pulled it out. Once unpacked and assembled (not difficult) it is a very good treadmill particularly for those desiring a low or zero elevation.
This is a perfect small home treadmill, even more perfect because my basement has low ceilings. It's perfect for me as an athletic female 5'6. Arrived earlier than expected and no damage. Just like many of you I was looking for a home treadmill and spent weeks looking up different treadmills on amazon and other sites. I almost got scared away and bought a more expensive treadmill but i am really glad I didn't. This thing was so easy to put together and it's light. Also comes with lubricant for the belt that you want to apply prior to use. I watched a YouTube video. I do recommend setting it up in the room you want to leave it in, but you can roll it around once it's folded pretty easily. I've ran on it for 3 miles at a time about 4 times now and also went for a 45 min walk with no problems. I bought extra silicone lube since I'm going to use it regularly. It's not a gym sized treadmill but if you're looking for something you can use to get a workout in at home this is certainly worth it. SO HAPPY!!! Will update if any issues but so far so good.
If you are looking for a simple treadmill to walk and run on, it's perfect. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that the more expensive ones have, we tend not to use and pay a lot for. The incline is not electronic. It is manual, so we aren't using it either. It is narrower than the more complex units, but wide enough to walk on. Shipping was fast and setup was easy. Took 10 minutes. It is just what we were looking for.
Set up was fine, started right up, ran on 6.0 for 5 minutes and completely turned off, getter error message on display that it is t getting enough power, even though it's plugged into the same wall outlet that ran an elliptical just fine. Thinking there was a bad motor, which is a problem considering it was manufactured in Nov 2020. Will update rating when I hear back from manufacturer.
"I just got this but so far it's amazing. The setup was so easy” maybe 20 min. On
My floor I needed a workout Matt” it wasn't great on my wonky wood floors. Great with the Matt”quiet and steady. I run hard and it's been great. The miles don't match up exactly with my Apple Watch, but very close. So far I'd 100% recommend this for the price! Now that it's getting cold, I'm so excited to be able to workout since I'm not going to the gym during the pandemic. This is just perfect!"
This is by far the worst treadmill I've ever purchased. I bought this treadmill for the low price and favorable reviews. Now , I'm beginning to wonder how many of these reviews are unbiased or verified reviews. I began to have issues with the belt after only two or three months and had to constantly tighten and lubricate the belt. I continued to use it and after less than ten months the treadmill is no longer working. I understand the purchase was on the inexpensive end, however it would behoove you to spend a little more money on something you can actually use for more than ten months.
I used this treadmill for walking 45 minutes each weekday for about a year and a half. Luckily I was not running, because when it decided to suddenly stop short for no reason I almost fell off. I realize this treadmill is low end, and I think the warranty was only a couple months, so I contacted support to at least figure out what happened and get an estimate on fixing. Well, phoning in was no good. Email got me a reply after over a week, asking me questions I already answered in my first email. Then they wanted pictures. Then asked me more questions. Each response was over a week from my email. When I finally thought they had all the information they needed, they just stopped emailing me. I have not been able to get in touch with them for about a month now. So I had enough of this horrible company and have ordered a treadmill from someone else. Hopefully that will go better. Stay away!
When we initially ordered this, it arrived with some plastic on the front of the machine cracked. Amazon arranged pick up of the damaged and shipped us a different one. It took about a week for the replacement however I am very satisfied with the purchase. I was looking for something cheap but would do the job. I didn't need anything to incline or do anything fancy. I've been using this for about a week now and it's very functional. I am about 5'4 and 160 lbs. we currently have this in our basement (unfinished) and it sits a bit tall. Our ceilings are about 7' so my 6' husband will likely not get to use this but thy was not our intention. It was very easy to set up as well, my husband unboxed it and had it set up within 30-45 minutes. I would definitely recommend to someone looking for a small, cheap and functional treadmill but doesn't need all of the bells and whistles.
"This is great for cold weather, indoor walking/running. Assembly was easy and the dashboard is simple.
The only thing that stump me was lubricating the belt. The instruction were clear required to be done prior to first use. It read apply in the middle of the belt and let it spread. I did not realize it meant under the belt top middle. The belt was so tight and has that boader, only able to lift the sides slightly. So I only lubed the sides.
But after first use the belt was out of alignment, ugh. Something else to learn. Thanks to the Youtube, I not only learned how to lubricate the belt, also learned how to align it. Once the belt was lubricated and realigned, it worked nicely, no resistance.
It was a great Christmas price, investment and upgrade to my stepper.
Hope this helps!"
never buy sunny treadmill again. stopped working after one year of normal use. burning smell and keep turning off during normal workout time.
"It's working fine.
When this arrived the carton was damaged so I submitted a query as to whether I should even open it. The email response said it would take 7-14 days for a response. It's been 14 days and no response.
I opened it and the only damage was one little clip arm on the front bottom plastic guard. It doesn't affect anything but it makes me wonder about customer service.
I'd classify it as a light duty treadmill. Perfect for my wife who just wants to walk fast. The total treadmill weight is approx. 106 lbs. Seems well made...it's been 2 weeks. I'll adjust this review + or - depending on my experience."
"We liked the Treadmill for its look, compactness, and options. It is a good buy. Unfortunately, it started making big rumbling noise (inside motor casing) after a week of use. I returned it but placed another order for the same treadmill.
Another reason is I am writing this review is Amazon's great customer support. I looked for an appropriate place to write my compliment but I could not find one.
With the machine I just returned, Amazon gave me a big discount when I reported a hair line crack of about half an inch on plastic casing. I fully intended to keep it had it not been for the motor issue. Unfortunately, I lost the discount as I have to return. When I have to return ultimately, all I need to do is pack and keep outside my house for UPS pickup. It is a great a convenience as I do not have to take to UPS myself."
"I will not recommend! I'm based in the Caribbean. I received this threadmill in November 2020, we are now in February 2021. Barely two months of use and the machine no longer works. A constant error message with a loud beep. I've made attempts to reach the manufacturers only to receive a ˜ticket #'
Till date, no feedback. Totally regret the purchase!"
This is a great machine for the money, and excellent for an elderly person who wants to keep in shape during the quarantine. Assembly took a lot longer than I liked because the screw and the bracket to keep it safe during shipment was a pain in my finger because the screw was bent and stripped, it took me 45 minutes to get it off. Afterward, it took about 30 minutes but the belt needed adjusting a day later.
Works great so far. Used about 2 hours a day by a few different people from 5'5-5'9 and up to 175lbs and able to jog/run comfortably. Not super noisy, hard to say how loud it is but easy to have tv at a low volume and hear the tv fine.
Shipment was quick and although the box was a little damaged the product itself wasn't. This treadmill is okay for beginners. I find that it is too narrow and every now and then my hands hit the corner of the hold bar. I feel like at lower speeds, the belt gets stuck momentarily. Overall good treadmill.
"We got this for our home this summer and it was really a worth purchase using it for 6 months and never had a problem it was very easy to assemble and started using in about 30 mins. Liked the quality of this treadmill for better than the cheap ones I was looking for.
It has a tablet holder and a cup holder and It also has 3 levels of height adjustments would have been better if there were a couple more and the plastic for stop magnet broke so we need to secure the magnet otherwise I can't use this. Overall it's a good purchase and what I needed for daily use."
Very easy to assemble and folds up as much as one could expect. Not too small to have a difficult time running, but small enough to save some space. Perfect for a less expensive, smaller alternative, and worth the money. I am on a second floor apartment, with wood flooring, and I can run without any complaints. I even pit a glass of water on the counter for the Jurassic Park, style test... and no ripples while running leads than a foot away.
I love this treadmill. Doesn't have a ton of bells and whistles but has everything I need. Folds up nicely and easily. I have two small kids and they haven't been able to open it- even if they did I have peace of mind that it has a hydraulic drop system. I am 5'9" and I do hit my hands on the handles when walking which is annoying but not a deal breaker. I would not go with a tread any less wide than this one and I'm glad that this provides 2"+ more than some of the other ones in width. My husband jogs on it and it's fine but might not be the best for real runners. I feel like it wobbles a bit more than gym treadmills but since I'm just a walker it isn't a problem. Very easy to unbox an assemble, I did it by myself. So far so good!
Quit working after 2 weeks. Was going to return, but the ordeal of taking it apart and packaging was a hassle. Luckily, my neighbor is an electrician and located a loose wire by switch and fixed my problem. It works again.
One can certainly purchase a higher end treadmill for much more that the Sunny model; however, this services us very well. My only critique is that it is not as "portable" as the ad would suggest. It does fold up, but it is still requires quite a bit of space to store it. We just keep ours unfolded, which I would not recommend if you are tight on space. Easy controls and has been durable thus far.
It's a good treadmill - nice features and I like the folding option for storage. One thing to note is that the warranty is only 180 days. I used to buy extended warranties all of the time and never used them, so I didn't bother purchasing the one that was offered by Amazon. The treadmill worked well for exactly 12 months of light walking usage (no running) and I did all the belt lubrications as recommended. About 10 minutes into a walk in January 2021, the motor just stopped moving and the treadmill is no longer functional. I don't know if this is common with treadmills, but right now I really wish I would have added on that extended warranty when I bought it.
My treadmill was delivered promptly. It comes essentially assembled right out of the box. There were only a couple of things my hubby was required to do to get it up and running for me. It seems to me that the machine is a little larger than the one shown in the picture with the female runner. Or perhaps that's just because I'm only 5'2" and slender. It might be too small, I think, for a large man. Make sure you check the weight limit, but it works perfectly for me. I am satisfied with the treadmill. The only thing I didn't like was that the box was banged up and torn in the shipping and there were a couple of places where the plastic molding was cracked. It's hardly noticeable and the slight damage doesn't interfere with the machine's performance. But, the packaging should be better to protect the machine.
Got this for my wife to use during the Texas heat we have now to add to the pandemic. I was a little worried after reading a few reviews that said theirs arrived with broken shrouds or otherwise damaged. Mine arrived in good shape with no damage to any plastic or metal components. All parts were in the box and they even included a light oil for keeping the treadmill maintained. Seemed to be packed very well so I don't know if the people with damage were just unlucky or if the manufacturer changed way the machine is packaged to eliminate shipping damage. Once it was powered up, everything works as it should and so far is working well. Time will tell and I'll try to update here if anything changes, but so far I'm very happy with the treadmill.
"Shipping seems to be rough in these machines. I noticed as I was opening the treadmill that the areas that held screws were cracked around screws. Not a big thing and not worth returning for but not cosmetically appealing either (3-4 cracked spots).
I used the machine as soon as I opened it and 3 times since...and my son has used it twice. So far so good. I had it up to 8.2 and it ran well. The incline adjustment is easy. The screen is easy to read. I really like the speed adjustments on the handles and on the screen.
I will say though...if you are a bigger person it may be too narrow for you. I am 5'3"" 170lbs and I feel like it could be wider. My 6'3"" husband will never use it (he will only run outside) but if he did he would be very uncomfortable as it would be too small for him.
All in all I am pleased and I think this will serve its purpose."
"I bought the Sunny Health Fitness TREADMILL SF-T4400 this wednesday (7/8), and I've set it up as instructed and did the below steps too.
Lubricated it with about 3/4 of the oil-bottle provided, and
Centered the running belt by tightening/loosening the screws at the end of the treadmill.
I did notice the ""Prog"" and the ""Mode"" buttons were not working or doing anything.
But still, I used it for the 1st day as it was running smoothly, and used it for 45 minutes.
The 2nd day before I started running I thought this below amazon-review (how to calibrate) may help fix the (Prog / Mode) buttons, and changed the F1 to 65, F2 to 8, F3 to 76 values as in below.
But it didn't work, the buttons still didn't do anything. And instead now, even from low-speeds to high-speeds the belt keeps jerking, or skids, or it feels like there is a lot of friction between the belt and the running-board underneath. and I can barely walk, and it makes it feel like I am not letting the belt run, or like I am trying to stop it.
I have looked for a lot of links on the internet and youtube, and everything keeps referring to a loose-belt, or the need to center-the belt, but it's not the case. I have already done it, and it's not loose. Also, see the suggestions to open up the motor and fix stuff, but didn't wanted to do all that, as it seems I just need to undo the above settings to defaults, and that it may fix this.
Can you please help me, tell what the settings were or the initial default values it came with, so I can set each of these F1 to F3 values to them, and expect it to run smoothly like it was running the 1st day.
I didn't not down the default values, so just tried to change the values a bit and left them at the below values. F1 -> 51 , F2 -> 5 , F3 -> 50 , and F4 to Empty. No Luck"
"I just received my treadmill and so far so good. Assembly was easy. The box did come damaged but everything inside seems okay. Oiling the belt was a little tricky as I didn't know how much of the lubricant I should use. I will oil it again today since I feel I didn't put enough. In total I would be using about half the bottle. There is a little bit of hesitation on the belt when I walk at lower speeds. After around 2.5 it goes away so it's not really a problem. Maybe more lubricant will help as well.
I will update in a month and see how things are going."
"We received our treadmill this afternoon and while I was our running errands our 15 year-old son and my wife assembled it. The only thing I did was connect the display unit because our son was unfamiliar with the plug and play connector.
The unit is beautiful and so well-made and engineered I am astonished at this price point.
Our son said the manual was super-easy to understand and very well done. I build stuff like motorcycles and cars I feel so left out...WAH!
I will amend this review after a few weeks but the kid is out on the back porch running his butt off so I think we are good."
So far so good. I use it to get steps while working in my office. There are two important things to note though: 1. Lowering or raising the handle requires you to use an Allen wrench each time, making that process time-consuming. That's mainly an issue if you plan to do that frequently. 2. The remote didn't come with a battery and didn't say which kind was needed. It does use the fairly common 2032 button battery which I correctly guessed.
This is a great little treadmill if you are on the fence about buying one, don't be- it's solid. Easy to unpack and set up. The support bar on mine was tighten and required me to use the Allen wrench they provide, however there was no mention in the manual that this was the case. It merely said to lift it up. I almost threw out my back trying to do so before loosening the screws. So if you are having trouble pulling up the support bar, this might help you out. You can use the treadmill with the support bar down, up to 2.5 mph. You must make sure the red emergency pull is on the yellow magnet on the control panel otherwise the treadmill wont turn on. The wrist remote requires a 2032 battery which is not listed in the manual. One thing about the wrist remote, if you hit the stop button, it will stop the treadmill quickly so best to use arrows to slow down. I have not completely tighten my support bar, and the treadmill will still work. I mention this because if you want to go from the up and down position the manual says you'll need to tighten and untighten the support bar with the Allen wrench. Many folks commented that wasn't ideal, especially for storage.
El producto es bueno, pero no le doy cinco estrellas porque primero no me gusto que no tiene alguna palanca para ajustar la caminadora al subir el sujetador de manos, trae con ella una llave de mano la cual no puedes perder y es sÃºper incÃ³moda hacer siempre este proceso para sacar y guardar, no es tan silenciosa como dice en las especificaciones, mÃ¡s bien la considero un poco ruidosa al trotar, las ventajas son que es pequeÃ±a y muy practica para almacenar, trae consigo un tipo control de mano , y se puede descargar una aplicaciÃ³n para ver tus avances
This is a really nicely built treadmill, it comes already setup and you don't need to do any of the setup, I found this to be extremely helpful. It's a nice size, has a good motor. Couple of things that's that I didn't like was that the way you have to fold the bar is tedious and takes too much time to tighten it all the way. But so far this is a great treadmill for the price, will have to see how this holds up in the long run
We have been scouting for a treadmill for a while, and decided to get a Proform from Walmart. BIG MISTAKE. We boxed that thing up, and returned it, it was too much trouble, the belt wouldn't stay put. So I started looking for no assembly required treadmills, and found this little cutie, and let me tell you if you are looking for something to just do some walking on, this is the machine for you. I literally just wanted a treadmill I could take out of the box, and start walking on. This is IT. It doesn't have all the frills, bells, and whistles of the big machines but that's not what I wanted. I just wanted something to do some indoor walking on. I was a little nervous because the weight limit was 220 and, I'm 252 but it doesn't seem to hinder the machine which is great. They give you a complementary bottle of oil, a remote control (which is super cool) a hex key for the arm thingies, the pull cord, booklet, and the phone/tablet holder. My only two complaints are that if you want the lcd screen to turn off completely you need to turn it off at the switch on the bottom, and the beeping from every button push but if those my only complaints... This is a fantastic treadmill, and has exceeded my expectations so far. It ships faster than it says it will btw. I will update if anything goes wrong.
"DO NOT BUY AS AN UNDER-DESK TREADMILL.
I bought this specifically because it was advertised as an ""under desk"" treadmill, so something you can put under a desk and get some light exercise while working from home or something like that.
The problem comes after you put it under your desk and turn it on, when the feedback interferes with your computer so badly that it turns your USB devices on and off over and over again while it's running. Trying to type on a keyboard? Have fun trying to do that. Moving your mouse? No you're not. Opening a file that's on an external hard drive plugged into your PC? Think again, pal! You would think at some point in time while they were testing a product designed to be used under a desk, they would have, oh I don't know, put it under a desk?! This is a catastrophic design flaw, it makes the treadmill unusable. Please don't waste your money like I did.
I went through extraordinary measures to try and accomodate the treadmill, moved my entire setup as far as the cables could reach and it's still doing it. This thing doesn't do the one thing it's supposed to do. ~$400 down the drain, completely wasted. And I already got rid of my old treadmill so now I'm stuck with this piece of garbage. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT A TREADMILL THAT GOES UNDER YOUR DESK!!"
This treadmill is tiny! It is only good for walking and only if you are already a very small person. Also, after only walking on it twice for about 15 minutes, it started doing a jerk every 10 to 15 seconds which almost made me fall off the treadmill. I used the silicone lubricant to make sure that was not an issue.
I bought this for my husband who is 6'1" and 205lbs and he really enjoys it! He usually does a steady jog at around 5mph to 6mph with no issues. Setup was easy with clear instructions. The app needs some help, but it's doable. He is not folding the bar back and up, but could see how that would get tiring after awhile. Other than that, it's a great compact treadmill.
"A nice, simple treadmill (just what I wanted). If you're a small person, you might use mover's discs to wrangle it into your house and into its desired location - it weighs a ton. So far, it works well, but I would have been lost without customer reviews that explained what the user manual did not. It is laughable, half-translated gibberish that leaves out some of the most important things a new owner needs to know:
Thanks to other reviewers, I knew that the remote needs a 2032 battery, that the gadget on the red string is the emergency switch, and that the magnet on the emergency switch must be connected to the yellow oval on the crossbar or it won't start.
I look forward to discovering what else the manual didn't tell me."
"Just got my treadmill today, and it was super easy to set up and to start using it! It took maybe 10 minutes to unbox, set up, and scan the manual. The QR codes (in the manual and on the phone holder) didn't work; the site wouldn't load. I found the Fit Show app in the Google Play store, though, and thought all was well. It's not. The app won't work without allowing it to know your location. (Um, it's a treadmill...it's not going anywhere!) It also asked for permission to access my contacts, make phone calls, take and access pictures and video. I denied all of those, and perhaps that's why the app won't let me register and make use of the features (like creating a workout) in the app. I sent a message to the seller, so maybe they'll be able to help. If so, I'll update my review.
Meanwhile, it does the basics just fine and it arrived at least a week earlier than promised. If I can get the app to work, it'll be a 5-star product!"
For the price, this treadmill meets my needs. Like other reviews, I don't like having to use the Allen wrench to move the bar up and down. One thing to be mindful of is how wide your gait is. This treadmill isn't wide, so you have to be mindful of this. Overall, I like it and I'm happy with my purchase thus far.
"We have very limited space and the pandemic has destroyed our ability to exercise consistently. The outside is too icy to walk or run, and the gym across the street has had two covid outbreaks.
As a result we researched and looked at a variety of treadmills online and finding decent ones that are not random fake companies with fake accounts was really hard! Thankfully we trusted this one on Amazon and relied heavily on others posts/reviews. So far this thing is perfect for our needs. My kids can walk for 20-30 minutes a day during their virtual PE classes, which is way better than running in place. My husband watches TV and walks in the morning. And I get in a nice 30 minute jog after work. My kids walk on 2.2 speed. My husbands walking speed is 3-3.5. My jogging speed is 4.7. We have not tried going any faster but supposedly it goes up to 7, and we probably won't even test it at that speed.
My only concern was when it arrived the display was scuffed. After I started jogging speeds my phone vibrated off the little stand and fell on the display, cracking it. I was super bummed out. Since then my husband has suggested I use a rubber band to secure it in place. Fixed"
I wanted a folding treadmill i can bring up to my office slide under my desk but also use in the living room. I can move it but its heavier than i accepted so carrying it up stairs by myself is a no. Set up was super easy. I have not had to use any oil on it yet, says after about 3 months you should. I goes fast enough i can get a light to med speeed jog on it, which i also enjoy. I did not buy this to sprint on and if your looking for that this is not for you. If you want a nice compact treadmill that you can walk on during a movie or at work this IS THE ONE for you!
I had been looking for treadmills that could fit under a couch or a bed because I have a small place and they range in price from $300-$1000 and I figured 500 was a good price to pay but this one was barely $400 I think I paid even less than that on an Amazon special but I've had it for two months and I'm pretty impressed. I will come back in six months or so and let you know if it's last it but without a gym membership and all the restrictions I just needed something I could do at home especially in the cold weather. But just says it says I have used it up to five it says it goes up to 6 And I am 150 pounds and they say it works up to either 225 pounds or 250 pound so you do have to take that into consideration. But the stride is good walking or running and being able to put it out of the way is a big plus
"Overall a nice little treadmill. It's great for small spaces and works just fine.
I don't like that you have to use a tool to put the arms up and down and there is a pause button when the arms are down but so far every time I try to pause when the arms are up it just turns off and when I hop back on the timer is reset and the speed is back down to 0.6.
Would I still recommend it to others? Yes."
"This is a good treadmill for the price. There are pros and cons to everything. Mine are simple!
Pros: small, folds down, adorably pink :), quiet, fits perfect under my bed, love the wrist unit, wheels for easy gliding / moving
Cons: running surface is short, you need to have the emergency safety cord attached even if the arms are down, no batteries for the wristband
For my use in a small studio apartment, this is great. I don't plan to be running marathons on this, so for walking and short runs it's great."
"Great Treadmill. It works great. We've been using it for running/walking. Love how compact it is and not too loud. Love the fact that the bar comes up to hold onto when running. We didn't feel safe just getting a treadmill without something to protect us if you trip or almost fall. My family was concerned about this so this model was the best compromise because you can use it under a desk with the bar down and then bring it up as well.
The one thing that was tough was having to adjust the bar with the tool. It's not as simple as we hoped. Other than that- we love it!"
"My expected delivery date was between the 16th and 19th of February. Imagine my surprise when it actually delivered today! The outter box was undamaged and the treadmill was all nestled and without any damage or scratches. I was so excited. Yet also a little hesitant because I purchased a different treadmill from a different company and it was dead on arrival and looked like it was returned by someone already and the company just reshippedit it to me to get my money.
When I unpacked and set up the treadmill I was overjoyed!! It worked and even had the brand new smell.
With out a doubt this treadmill was made for me. I ran a mile on it this evening and when done threw out the boxes it came in. This baby has a new home. :)
Yes, you have to use an allen wrench that came with the treadmill, to pull up and diwn the handles, but a few extra minutes to do this really isn't a deal breaker.
I'm so glad I reviewed all the other treadmills and decided on this one. Best choice of them all!"
I LOVE this treadmill. I got it for both running and walking while I work at my sit/stand desk and it's perfect! It doesn't take long at all to convert it from under the desk to a full treadmill and the settings are easy to understand and use. My only complaint would be that the watch came without a battery or instructions for what type of battery, but as some other reviews noted its a CR2032 battery and with it, the watch works great as well.
The digital display screen was broken on arrival and the belt will malfunction at times and thrust you forward rapidly without warning. So dangerous! It also happened to my husband while he was using it as well. Thankfully Amazon refunded me. Don't waste your time or money. Spend a little more and get something with better quality.
You don't have to assemble anything. It is supplied with oil and an Allen wrench. You can only run when the bar is up. Slim enough to slide under my sofa. I got this to recover from Covid-19, I was struggling to walk long distances without loosing my breath and this is great.
I have owned 2 other treadmills and wanted an easy put out of the way treadmill. This is perfect! Fast shipping and quick response from the seller. Easy to assemble, literally pull out the box and place the holder for your phone or iPad and tightened the arms up. Very smooth and accurate in time, distance and calories burned!
I didn't want a big, obnoxious, loud treadmill. So I did some research and found this one. It's small, quiet, easy to use. The Murtisol has nice features, including a floor display. There's a place for your phone or tablet. No water bottle holder but that's okay. I'm pleased with my purchase.
Perfect for those of us that have zoom meetings where you can turn the camera off. I can walk for the duration of zoom meetings while still being able to participate. The treadmill Is quite and you can exercise while family sleeps. I could not get the app to work properly.
"I love it! Just what I was looking for!
I'm 130 pounds and my husband is 172 and we both have used it with no problem. I use it 5 day a week 30-45 mins running and walking. It fix right under the couch with no problems great compact treadmill"
If you are looking for an inexpensive treadmill, this is it. However, the couple times I tried running on it, it did not feel sturdy enough. It was almost as though the belt is too loose for the machine. But, it's pretty quiet and does well as a walking treadmill. Overall great value for the price.
This unit is solid, and is working well. But raising and lowering the bar is a bit of a pain. You have use the Allen wrench. The manual is a bit flakey. It was written in English by a Chinese person. The wording is odd. No biggie though.
Product is sturdy but arrived with a piece broken. There is no way to contact seller directly outside of Amazon's messaging which doesn't allow me to send photos. I am displeased with the lack of support since I have been trying to request a replacement piece for about a week without success. Product is good, but the inability to contact customer service adequately makes me not recommend this seller.
It makes that space in my house very cozy to do a quick little exercise. Surprisingly it doesn't make a lot of sound and works very well. I'm just a little worried about my warrantee. But overall it's a great product!
I use this product for literally hours every day since it arrived. I use it under my standing desk for some much needed movement. It doesn't interfere with any electronics in my office, and easily rolls away when I don't want to use it. It is really quiet and sturdy. I have suggested it to a number of friends for a much needed boost to our working days!
I just received it and plugged it in and the display is flickering instead of a steady light. Dont think it should be like this and it's really annoying to see. I was so happy about receiving this, and this is definitely a problem
"I've been running on this ""treadmill"" about four to five times a week for three weeks. During the second week I started to notice cracking and popping noises coming from underneath the tread. Slowly a large divot started to form underneath the tread towards the mid-back area.
Now the machine makes screeching noises as the bottom of my sneaker depresses the treadmill track through this large divot. It's like running through cushioned potholes.
I'm about 190lbs.
Running at level 6 for 35 minutes"
This treadmill is easy to use and can be put away conveniently. This portable treadmill quality is good and lightweight. I think it's more suitable for light weighted person. Overall, not bad.
It worked great for the first couple weeks but now the belt slips consistently making it impossible to use without risk of injury. We need to figure out how to fix it and it's super disappointing after very little use.
Good for price, only downfall so far is when u stop to go to bathroom or any reason it zeros out and doesn't keep track, which really sucks!
"It's minimum and maximum speed are kilometers (0.6-7.5km, NOT miles) disappointing as I was actually looking forward to 6.0 miles/hr with this treadmill. But it will max out just under 5 mph.
Keeping it since it does work well under my desk and I got 12k+ steps the first day."
Assembly was fine. However when trying to exercise, the belt continuously sticks and caused me to trip, and lose my footing. I tried this at various speeds and it still continued. I would not recommend this item to anyone, mostly to prevent others from injury.
I love this treadmill and it serves its purpose. Better for shorter people. My teenage son has much longer legs and has a hard time running on it. But overall, a great purchase.
As a whole, it works fine! Stows away behind our couch just fine. The bolts were extremely tight to loosen, which resulted in them being stripped. Also one of the buttons is a little wonky but I attribute that to being beat up during shipment.
Nice sleek design but not useable as it has electrical issues out-of-the box. Keeps causing breaker to go out soon as I turn it on and start it up. Badly wanted it to work (for the price) so tried it in multiple locations/outlets (easy to wheel it around too) but just defective. Not taking another chance with another one of these...At least it's light weight to return it back for credit!!
"I love this treadmill. It's small but mighty! Fits perfectly in my office without being in the way! I just review this yesterday and have put 14 miles on it already!
Shipping was super quick, it came almost 2 weeks early! Setting up was super easy!
I gave it 4 stars only because I wish it had a incline mode. Also, the weight limit is 220."
This is a nice treadmill! I just got it today (it came 5 days early) and I love it. It looks nice, it is super quiet and was very easy to set up. It is very compact and lightweight. I tried it for a few minutes but I can't wait to get in a real work out. Will update if I have any issues. Highly recommend.
Me acaba de llegar la caminadora y creo que esta excelente, anteriormente comprÃ© otra que lamentablemente no era de muy buena calidad y era mÃ¡s costosa pero sin embargo estÃ¡ caminadora me sorprendiÃ³ por su precio, calidad y rendimiento. Sin duda la recomiendo.
Very pleased with this purchase. It's easy to store and the weight (approx 70lbs) makes it easy to move around and store. It's exactly what I needed.
Received this in pink 2 weeks ago. I'm only 5'0 but yes...you can DEFINITELY jog on this even moderate run. It is shorter in length so if you're tall, jogging might be an issue. Love it, no issues so far. Pull out the box and start walking
Bought this since weather was too chilly to walk outside. I wanted an easy to assembling walking pad and pleasantly impressed. For the money - it's a great treadmill. It's a great size in that it's portable but wide enough tread for me. I walk every night on it. My mom ended up ordering the same one. I am super happy I got it.
Really only made for walking not running.
Just got this delivered today set it up in less than 5 minutes worked really well did 30 minutes .only thing I don't like as you have to use the Allen wrench to lift up the on bar. But I did read that in other reviews so I was aware
I've had mine for 2 weeks already. I loved it at first. Yet The machine has like a screech when I try to run on it. It also feels like there's a bump in the middle back end of the treadmill. Has anyone had this issue? I've used the liquid that comes w it and adjusted the mat evenly
I spent weeks researching an affordable treadmill since having to work from home. I'm so glad this was the winner! It's perfect! It's light enough for me to move back and forth from my home office to the living room when I'm not working, assembly is 30 seconds. Money well spent!!
Sleek and got up and running in less than 10 minutes. Perfect for our small space.
This item was perfect. Exactly what I wanted. It was easy to put together and really quite. Save so many space but still does the job.
Very easy to use and easy to assemble. I'm 76 and it works for me.
Arrived and did not work. Everything lit up once plugged up but could not get the treadmill to start.
Everything thing is great!!. Assembly easy! very sturdy my spouse weights 180 lbs and he loves it no pain on your feet, back, or legs other than the exercise. Wow for the price I give it a ðŸ’¯
I love it! I was worried it would shake a lot while using it but it doesn't at all! It's super compact too! Have it under my desk. Also it was incredibly easy to assemble! Get those steps in!
Exactly what I was looking for!! Small, light, basic, and still perfect for a smooth jog! If you're on the fence, jump! This is a good purchase! Shipped/delivered in 1 week!!!
I wish it were converted for the American market and used English & miles instead of Chinese/kg. Otherwise, I'm very happy with it!
Great for price and shipment came much earlier than expected...thank you!
This was such a great investment for my health journey. This treadmill is the perfect size. The HP on the treadmill is perfect.
Not really sure how to rate this... I cant turn the darn thing on if anyone has had this issue and figured it out please tell me what you did ... Need Help !!!!
Easy set up. Out of box and set up in under 15 minutes. Perfect size for smaller room.
Perfect for my small second bedroom. Fits great and works perfectly.
Easy set up, however no battery with wrist strap that suppose to run the machine. Other than that pretty happy with purchase.
Not as heavy duty as it appears. Work for only 1 day and started making noises. Had to return.
Happy with my purchase..
Perfect for my small living space! Works well!
Muy buen tamaÃ±o para espacios pequeÃ±os, pero no sirviÃ³, y es complicado regresarla..
Amazing! I I walk and jog on it everyday!!!!!
Nice treadmill!
The perfect size for me. Easy to assemble.
Can't get treadmill to start! Now what?!?
Excellent for the price. Great for fast walking.
Best treadmill easy to use and very easy to fold
Got it set up in 5 minutes
I love it
Excelente! EN TODO...
It's easy to use
This item sticks. after following instructions and tightening over and over i still cannot use thus treadmill without getting a jolt when it's stuck. It makes it scary to use. I have never been able to use it. Waste entirely of money. I am 140 lbs.
"Assembly & Operation: The most difficult part about the assembly was unboxing. I raised/locked the arm, oiled the belt, and off I went. I can walk and run comfortably on this machine with no skipping or dragging of the belt. (Note, I am petite). I would definitely not exceed the weight limit on this if you intend on jogging at 4+ MPH. You can control the functions from the control panel on the arm or on the base. The speed and distance seem accurate. I really can't say too much more about what a great unit this is out of the box. The logistical problems, however, lie a bit deeper.
Customer Service: I couldn't get the remote to work despite trying CR2032 and CR2016 batteries. To date neither the seller nor Murtisol direct will respond to my inquiry. This gives me pause. I don't need the remote and it is not required for operation, but after half a dozen emails and no response, I have a feeling the 90-day warranty is probably non-existent. As a result I purchased a 2-year protection plan which drove the overall cost up.
Folding/transporting: the wheels are made of dinky plastic and only roll in one direction and are only located on the front of the unit (moving forward/backward), so if you are thinking of sliding this sideways under a sofa or bed, think again. Otherwise it is fairly nimble to move around due to its lighter weight (70 lbs vs 200+ for a traditional treadmill).
My overall assessment: I hope, and would be happy if this lasted three years for me. It works great, is convenient, and is priced right, but I just don't trust these fly-by-night sellers/manufacturers. I do wish Amz would vet their sellers a bit better, so at least as consumers we don't have to weed through 100s of fake reviews and possibly get burned by an imaginary company with no customer care or legitimate business presence. That being said, this was a dice roll and overall I am glad I have my ""Murtisol"" 2 in 1 machine for as long as it works properly!"
"Works great and easy setup, though I'm too tall, my step is too wide and stride too long to be comfortable on this
Great product though"
Broke within thirty days of having it. Never has been sturdy and the running mat almost always slips. Not worth the money. Spend the extra few hundred and get the more quality brands.
"I ordered ""Murtisol 2 in 1 Folding Treadmill"" from this seller.
I have the following issues with the product delivered to me:
1.SAFETY ISSUE: The running belt skids/slips frequently when using 3mph+ speed making it dangerously slippery for the user. My husband was about to fall thrice and so we stopped using at 3mph+ speeds.
2. ALIGNMENT issue: The belt is not in the middle of the treadmill - it is touching the left side but almost 1 inch away from the right side. Can provide images if you want. I think, for this reason, I hear sounds from the belt rubbing against the left side. Is this a known problem/issue?
2.The MULTIFUNCTIONAL LED DISPLAY has scratches all over it making the treadmill look used and old even though we ordered brand new from this seller.
3. The PHONE HOLDER is bigger in size than the slot it is made for, so it does not fit into the slot."
"Excellent quality and meets 100% of my needs. It is compact but with sufficient running area. I'm 5'3 130lbs, feel very safe and sturdy to run on it. Usually do 5.5 for 15-30 min.
I would not recommend putting it away after use.1) It is still quite heavy, and is a bit hard to move around by myself even with two wheels. It might make more sense to slide something (sofa or table) over it If you have to save the space. 2) Also you will need the wrench to put down/lift up the handles, not straight forward enough for an everyday task. 3)After all, its unfold form is not that big.
My only complaint is that my phone do not stay, because the phone holder vibrates when I run and my phone slides away as it vibrates. Put a rubber band around the holder to secure the phone and solved the problem.
I only use the control panel so did not test the phone app or the remote control."
I have been shopping for a compact size treadmill for some time and this foldable handle and pink color caught my eye. I don't have too much space under my desk, this is the perfect size. It is not too heavy and can easily move around. This treadmill has provided the whole family some good exercises. We enjoyed walking and running on a steady speed. As I don't use the handle too much, so it's not a bother when I have to use the tool to unlock to move the handle up and down on occasion. I like it that I can use without downloading the app. Overall it's a good quality and inexpensive model.
I bought this treadmill for my kids. we only take 15 minutes to assumeble together.had it about couple weeks and so far it's been good. It's perfect size for childrens. It is quiet and compact which I like. My priority when buying was to save space and it is perfect for this. It folds very easily to store under furniture. It is a little heavy so I wouldn't suggest moving up and down stairs very often.All in all, it's a great buy for the price most definitely.
"I have been using it for almost a month. So far this treadmill is great! Easy to use, it came completely assembled. There also have a little place for my iPhone and remote, better then expected quality.
When I walk on it I don't feel like on the machine. It's not very big but it feel stable and safe. The only regret is the 220lb weight limit, which is probably reason for its small size. It also has a safety latch which is a very visible red color where I can get it anytime."
"Easy to assemble! We really like the safety tether, as our toddler tried to turn it on and she can't reach that part so it is always unable to function and chance hurting her
We were hesitant to purchase due to few reviews, but have not been disappointed yet."
"I bought this treadmill to get my steps in while at work and have my morning exercise. And I honestly love it and don't regret the buy. I am able to place it right under my desk when I am on calls and since I rarely use the hand rail I can just lift it and place it against the wall at the end of the day.
FYI you do need to buy the battery for the wrist remote since it does not come with one."
Ok so I was skeptical for sure but I am very happy with this product! I am a fitness instructor, teaching 2 classes a week at a local gym but with my kids now all doing online classes I wanted to try this compact treadmill so I could stay home on the days I don't teach class & still get a workout in. I love that it's small & not bulky...it really is perfect!
Seismic is good, small volume does not occupy space! There are wheels under the treadmill for easy movement! I bought it for fast walking, because I am not suitable for running, stride fast to walk 3,000 steps a day, is good for losing weight and healthy body! Mobile phone download App is also very simple to operate, you can show the number of steps! For the family that rents a house, or the family that the house is relatively small very recommended!
Sooo I gained a good amount of weight over the COVID shutdown which I like to call the corona 15. I bought this because I sit on my bum all day working remotely (besides the occasional snow shoveling) and playing games. I wanted to be more active with the time I had, so I purchased this treadmill because they it served two functions: regular treadmill and under the desk treadmill. The treadmill combined with my standing desk makes for a perfect combo. I now walk about 1-2 hours while working and it did take some getting used to, but after a few days of practice I am now able to walk and work with ease. I mainly use the foot touch controls which have been very responsive. This is not your typical treadmill as it doesn't have all the bells and whistles(high impact shock absorbers, hr monitoring) but if your looking for a treadmill that is good for walks and light jogs then this is perfect and unbeatable for the money.
Ok, I about nearly left a bad review until finally realized as I was lifting this thing to put it back in the box...I see the damn switch! Instructions leave much to be desired. The unit is solid however. It did come a little scraped, but they have 12 month warranty, so if anything happens to it, at least you know they'll be able to fix it. I did NOT want to return this thing....it's heavy (not as heavy as a regular treadmill, but it's a workout to move it lol). Do not expect any protective plastic film...but this feels well built. Just make sure to turn the switch on (it's under the treadmill and I didn't even see it until i lifted the whole unit). 4 stars because it needs better instructions, but good for the price.
"I was looking for an under desk treadmill for use when the weather isn't that great outside and to get some workout when we are locked in during the pandemic. After doing a bit of research, I found this product and the description matched my expectations. I bought this to test if it was indeed as compact, powerful and easy to use as it stated and to my surprise it was.
The packaging was very simple - the treadmill, user manual, lubricating oil container and a hex spanner. I was able to unpack, lift, move, and setup the treadmill with ease. The wheels definitely help to move the treadmill from workout location to under couch or it's storage location. Instructions were very easy to understand and it started off with ease upon plugging into regular 110v socket.
After the system booted itself, I was able to use the controls in the handrail to start, stop, control speed. There is an emergency RED stop button the movement immediately. There is also a stop button that slowly stops the treadmill. The usual Speed + and - buttons increase the speed by about 0.2 miles and the 3 and 6 buttons speed up the treadmill to 3 or 6 miles per hour immediately for a jump start.
I have tried it a few times and so far it has worked well. The user guide says that the treadmill comes pre lubricated for immediate use and that I need to refill lubricant oil after about 100 miles. I will update this review after extended use and also when I hit 100 miles. So far this seems like a really good product for worth it's value."
"Update 1/31/2021:
This treadmill is everything I was looking for. Works great, and is very quiet compared to my older one from years ago.
The seller was prompt in resolving a warranty issue with the bar alignment.
Update: 1/26/21...after about 1 week of daily use, this unit has impressed me with it's quiet performance. Despite the structural alignment defect, it runs like a champ. So simple to lower and raise the grab bar and move this treadmill around on it's wheels. Keeps a steady pace, and easy to adjust the speed up or down in 0.2 mph increments.
The phone easel on the grab bar is set at a perfect angle for my viewing. Taller people may not like it, but it's perfect for me (I'm 5'1""). The belt is wide and long enough for me to walk and jog, but takes up so much less space than my old Pro-Form, which was a good unit, but too bulky for our small space.
I received my Urevo treadmill today (2-in-1 Underdesk treadmill) and the fold-down/up bar is a bit out of alignment. The problem is that the bar is attached to the walking surface on each side, but one side is about 1/2"" closer to the front of the unit than the other, putting the bar out of alignment.
The unit runs well, keeps it's speed, and is pretty quiet. I've walked 3 days in a row now for 2 miles each, and it's doing well. I'm looking into a warranty exchange because of the bar alignment."
"Fast delivery in California. Ordered it on 1/25/21, arrived at 9am on 1/38.
I bought it for its 2.5hp and good price and noticed the price has gone up
$20, maybe due to popularity. It's still a great price and investment!
Extremely easy to assemble, but had the hardest time turning it on until I finally found the switch on the underside of the treadmill next to the power cord outlet. This feature isn't specified in the manual and should be added in.
Control panel brightens after power on.
Handlebar secures up and folds down easily.
Follow the instructions on filling the lubricant. I used 1/2 bottle.
Its easy emergency shut off doesn't come with a cord, make sure the red flap is magnetically secured before using. To stop, push the red stop button to release the magnet.
It's super quiet when running on its own. You will hear the running belt friction during actual walking/running, but not a big deal.
Large foot pad is also what I preferred.
2/12/21 update:
My only regret is not getting this treadmill at the start of telecommuting in March 2020!
This is the BEST $400 spent!
I've been using the treadmill everyday and my bad knee isn't acting up at all. I've even started light jogging to up the heart rate.
It's so smooth and quiet, which I credit it to the 2.5hp, and extremely sturdy!"
Had it for a week and so far I love it! It's not small enough to fit under my couch but it's very easy to fold up and hide behind it. It makes some light noise so I haven't tried using it during work but the noise isn't even noticeable while watching tv. I'll update my review if there are any issues but so far it's great. Oh the only thing I don't love is that the stop button is easy to hit and I've bumped it a couple times on accident. I think this is probably better than the alternative of it being difficult to find. I'll just need to adjust my form a bit to get used to not bumping it.
I narrowed my decision down to this treadmill and one other (who will remain nameless). When I asked a question to Urevo I heard back in 2 hours. The other company with the more expensive treadmill took a long time to get back to me and I got the impression their command of English was not great. Anyway I received the Urevo treadmill lightning fast in 2 days! Setup was straightforward and easy. The only moment of uncertainty came when I was trying to move the handlebar up to the use position. (I saw one other user seemed to have an issue with this). When the tabs for the handle are turned forward the bar can maneuver forward. Once the bar is up, move the tabs pointing towards the back of the treadmill and it will be locked when upright. One area for improvement. When I folded it down to wheel it, the handlebar doesn't lock and will push up even when in the lock position. I would have been nice to be able to grip the handlebar and use that to move it while wheeling. So far the function of the machine seems good. I'm used to a full sized treadmill and this has a lower feel that I adapted to quickly. Will add more info down the road when it's been used a bit more. *The first time I rolled and put it away the remote fell out of it's spot near the foot of the treadmill.
I ordered this treadmill because I live in a small apartment but needed something to stay active indoors during the pandemic. This treadmill was a perfect choice. It's compact and easy to maneuver when you need to get it out of the way. You can hear the friction of the belt against the platform while it's in use, but overall, it's not too loud. I like that it can still be used with the handle lowered and it comes with a convenient little remote. That will allow me to repurpose it for use with a standing desk when I have the space. It's also sturdy. When I was looking for compact treadmills this is one of the only options that supports up to 265 lbs.
"Like so many during COVID, I found myself feeling pretty restless without access to a gym, and the idea of wearing a mask while working out was not appealing. After a few YouTube videos and comparing other treadmills, I opted for the UREVO 2 based on speed (one of the rare compact treadmills with a speed higher than 5-6) and shape (handlebar appeared sturdy but not awkward to maneuver or put down for storage).
The treadmill arrived in half the shipping window I was originally given (3-4 weeks). The package is pretty large/heavy, but even being on the shorter side it was relatively okay to maneuver with a dolly. Yes, even in an apartment and having to drag it from the lobby to my apartment. If you live in an apartment and don't have a dolly or someone to help you, this will be a challenge.
Once in my apartment, I was happy to find all I needed to do was take the treadmill out of the box, lock the handle bar in place, and slightly tighten the belt for it to be ready to go! No issues with the handle bar (no dings and was aligned). Even at speed 2.6 it's pretty fast/like a brisk speed walk. The first few times I ran the treadmill it made a weird whirring sound but after awhile the noise faded. Also, given that it's new don't be shocked if you smell some rubber (like a brand new tire). As I've continued to use it, the smell has decreased.
I live on the 2nd floor in an apartment complex, and put the treadmill in a carpeted room. However, I did purchase some small rubber mat squares to help lessen any noise for my downstairs neighbors. So far I've only used the treadmill with the 2.6 setting as I'm getting back into cardio exercises, will update if there's a drastic change once I start running on it. Even though I purchased it when the price was raised ($419 vs the $380-$390), I'm still happy with it."
I have been trying to get a treadmill for months, 2 other companies charged me but ran out of stock and never delivered. By chance I came across a review for this treadmill on youtube and I ordered it and it was shipped the same day I ordered it. Delivery was fast, no assembly and so far it is working great. It is great to be able to get the walks in when it is too cold to walk outside. Thanks for an awesome product.
Had this for about a week. Super simple and works straight out of the box. I weigh 230lbs and have been walking and jogging on it everyday to try and lose some weight. As a side bonus we've been trying to train our puppies to walk on it when it's too cold or raining outside. I am 5'9 and my stride walking and jogging is fine. It can actually go fast than I'm comfortable jogging, so I have a goal. Walking while working at my standing desk is quiet and an amazing way to increase steps while working.
Delivered quickly and without issues so far. Pretty easy setup and operating. I have used it several times already. I found it easy to move around and tuck under the bed but it does weigh more than 50lbs so it might be too much for some. The noise is moderate. When on a video conference some people could hear it while others could not, so it just depends. The size is really compact and doesn't take up much room. I chose this one because the walking area was wider and longer than others along with the motor being 2.5 instead of 2.25. I did some research in advance and the 2.5 is recommended for those that wish to use it to run. I am really happy with this purchase. Good quality for the price in my opinion.
Great budget friendly treadmill. The width is wider than most treadmills around this price range which is great, but it is also shorter, so if you're tired, make sure you don't fall off. When I got the package, it was on the heavier side (maybe I'm weak) and I needed help to carry upstairs. Once open, it comes fully assembled so you just plug in and go! I run everyday for 5K on this machine and it gives a really good workout. Another convenient feature that you don't find anywhere is the silicon oil dispenser for the treads. It has a compartment for you to pour oil into instead of lifting the tread itself. Two things that are on the petty negative sides: 1. Though not often, you will need to readjust the tread as it will be off centered every once in a while. 2. The phone tray on the bar is nice but not good posture if you're going to be watching netflix while using it. I used a table and a stand for my ipad to fix this. Overall, amazing product for the price and highly recommend.
"Okay a few things that might help you is:
After you take it out of the box and plug it in, there's an on switch at the bottom to the right.
You need to lock the bar in place from the bottom, you can move the stoppers to lock it in and undo to unlock it.
If you press the emergency stop, a hatch will swing down under the button. I didn't realize it and thought it broke but in reality all I needed to do what swing it back up.
If you are storing it under your bed, under a crib, under a couch (if it fits), keep a blanket over it when not in storage so dust or crumbs don't accumulate. You can clean the belt with a little water and a paper towel but be extremely careful to not turn it on while damp.
It goes extremely fast (the reason I bought this model), so be cautious when using high speeds. It goes up to 9 miles per hour and there's a high chance you won't use it's full power. It's THAT fast.
It comes with a small bottle of lube that I almost threw away by accident. If you didn't get one, check the trash. You can lube the treadmill by opening the oil lid that's on the left hand side.
Also wear good shoes because I didn't know my sneakers weren't adequate until I first used the treadmill.
It's not silent, but I watch tv while I use it anyways."
I got tired of walking in cold weather, so ordered this treadmill. To my surprise, this was a good investment, fits nicely under my stand up desk in my home office, very convenient to get my steps in during the work day. Easy to move around and put away for the weekend. Highly recommend!
"The product is great easy to maneuver, reasonable noise level. Works and looks just like advertised.
The MANUAL and set up instructions are TERRIBLE. There is no mention of a power switch in a place not easily seen. We spent an hour fiddling trying to get it turned on reading the manual several times. We found the switch by accident. It would have been easy to assemble if they mentioned to find and turn on the switch. Really upset wasted an hour and because of this. Was ready to send back as inoperable. Such an easy fix.
Once we were able to turn on was happy. They turned a strong 5star review to a 3star because of this."
The treadmill throws a breaker every time in use, so not usable. This is not thin enough to slide under a sofa. The cord is really short.
I order this as I have a small city apartment (650 sq feet) and I have given up on being able to go back to a public gym anytime soon. I liked this treadmill as it can be flat on the floor in a room in a small apartment and it is not as visible as most pieces of exercise equipment. Overall, it works well as I do not have a visibly bulky piece of exercise equipment in my very small living room/dining room (16'7"x 12'7"). And if I have guests, I can quickly slip it underneath my bed and get it totally out of the way. I mostly use it to power walk but I have done light jogging. I am 5'4" and I feel my stride takes up about 75% of the belt. Not sure how it would work for a taller person. I also like the convenience as I work from home. I can quickly jump on it and get a few steps in between conference calls. In a crowded city, it is also nice to get in a power walk/jog without having to wear a mask. It appears to be well made and I like the fact that there are 2 sets of controls, one on the remote and one on the bar. For treadmills with just the remote, I have read reviews that once the remote is broken, the whole treadmill is done. It is nice to have an option if one fails with this treadmill. The noise level is average for a treadmill but I bought a treadmill mat to dampen the noise and the neighbors have not complained yet!
Really wished this would work but it arrived with a misadjusted bar (which couldn't be fixed) and had problems handling my 220 pounds without belt stutter. Too bad, I really wanted to keep this. They did accept the return and picked it up with a full refund. Might be really great for someone much lighter. I ended up getting a Proform City L6 which could handle my weight but doesnt allow you to operate without the control panel elevated
I like it ... my only thing is I find myself adjusting the belt a lot .. when you walk on it .. the belt moves to the right a lot and the direction are not as clear far as how you adjust the belt ... I like that it's a specific place you pour the oil instead of just squirting it under the belt not knowing if you're doing it right ... so far so good .. it came in tact now cracks or pieces came off .. that was my fear since for other treadmills people complained about packaging that is really the only reason I did pick this one because they packages the treadmill very well and there was all kinds of dings and dents and holes in the package and it still came in perfect shape so I'm happy they packaged it very well besides that it still works and I was using it everyday but then stopped but will continue to use everyday starting next week
Amazing treadmill bought it after watching Christina Marie review it on YouTube. Been using it for about two weeks with zero issues I like that is quiet and the size is perfect for our small basement. Only two minor problems .1 the way to turn it off you have to stop it and hit the switch on the bottom I thought if I only hit stop it will turn off by itself but after a few minutes it only goes into standby and the control lights stay on. 2 it doesn't have a stand to put it away vertically but I still just placed it behind my couch other that I love it! will see how it holds up in a year
"This treadmill is incredible! While it was delayed in coming (due to winter weather) once we got it it was simply a matter of taking it out of the box. No assembly required! At first I was frustrated because the belt was really jumpy when stepped on. However, reading the manual led me to adjust the tension on the belt with the enclosed allen wrench and its a smooth runner now.
All I wanted was a simple treadmill to walk on and even though it goes fast enough to run...it won't be me running...It can be moved on the wheels from room to room. I'm very satisfied now..."
I live in a factory converted apartment, where you can hear people walking around. My place is small, one bedroom. I researched and shopped around until I found this treadmill. I LOVE IT! It's quiet, easy to move because of size and weight, and very easy to use. I'll admit, took me a while to find the power button(underneath front right side) but once I did, it was ready to use. It's the best thing I could have done for myself and a great way to start 2021 in the snowy east coast. I'd recommend it to anyone, but especially for anyone with a small space who doesn't live on the first floor!
Shipping was extremely fast. Setup was a breeze since it was already fully assembled; I was literally walking on it within 10 minutes of unboxing and most of that time was spent just looking for the perfect place to put it. I only wish the cable was a little bit longer, but it's not a big deal. I am happy with how compact and easy to use it is so I'm glad I went with this one.
I spent so many hours researching treadmills and finally decided on this one. It is exactly what I was hoping for I love it in every way. I did have an issue with a piece of metal keeping the safety stop switch from turning off but with a flashlight I found this little random piece of metal that was in the way and removed it and everything worked fine. I did reach out to customer service and they got back to me within 24 hours but I had already solved it!
"The first one didn't work. Absolutely fantastic customer service. They exchanged the product for another one and were very nice and professional.
The new one meets every expectation.
Easy to set up and take down, extremely quiet so I can use it at work. I went from zero exercise to between 4 & 5 miles a day. Thank you!!"
"Not bad. Easy setup, although the instructions for the oil refill were a bit confusing we figured it out.
Initially, when you first start the treadmill, there's a slight noise to it but we kept pumping that oil in the reservoir until the noise stopped.
The treadmill has been keeping our household occupied. The kids enjoy the light weight and maneuverability that it offers, easy to operate also.
I do wish it had adjustable heights for some incline walking. Even if it was something that was a manual adjustment.
Overall, we recommend this product. Feels good to walk and run without wearing a masks."
I've had this for a couple weeks now and am loving it so far. I mainly use it for a light jogs (4-5mph) but it does go above 6mph, no incline. I like that I can just plug it in the outlet right out of the box and start jogging, no installation required. It fits nicely underneath my bed and to slide it out easily, I put two moving pads on the side where there are no wheels. For a great workout, I take tread bootcamps on the Peloton app. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.
This is a great basic treadmill! My wife and I love to walk outside when we can but when the weather is bad we needed something to get our miles in for the day! This treadmill fills that need perfectly for a great price! It is lightweight, easily folds up and fits in a small space. The wheels makes it easy to maneuver anywhere in the house! Very quiet and seems to be very sturdy so far.
I've only had this about a week and really like it. Took a minute to figure out aligning the belt properly but when I got it the treadmill was good. It has a bit of a bounce when you first start walking or are walking at the slowest pace, but if you turn it up one notch it works smoothly. It takes some getting used to when using it while working. I've been using it while watch TV too, so less sitting around in general. Be sure to stretch before and after.
I've only had it for an hour but so far I love it! It isn't the most quiet machine, but it's sturdy and compact. I have a very small house and this just fits perfectly in the corner. My husband is a big guy and it was hard to find a compact treadmill that holds up to 265 pounds like this one does!
Great treadmill for fast walking. Very easy set up. Fairly quiet - still sounds like a treadmill but didn't feel like it would disturb the neighbors. Can roll it around and seems sturdy. Like how there is a special place in the treadmill to put the treadmill lubricant (haven't needed to do that yet). Needed something simple to keep active during these cold days, and I'm also staying away from gyms for now during the pandemic. This fits my needs!
I first opened the treadmill and read all the instructions before plugging it in. I plugged it in and pushed the power button on the remote and panel at the top and it wouldn't turn on. Come to find out there is a power switch on the bottom of the machine not mentioned any where in the instructions. Machine is fabulous, loving it so far, it's quiet and sturdy!
"Arrived DOA, got money back, seller only welling to provide label for return, wont send carrier to pickup. So I have to spend extra time calling FedEx and turned out the label seller provide is only for drop off, so FedEx can't send their drive to collect the merchandise.
Now I need to spend more time calling waste company to pick up this junk."
"Simple to operate. Although the on/off switch is well hidden, it is easy got find if you know it is located at the power cord.
Some instruction would be helpful, but it is easy to set up and run with just a little thought."
This treadmill is perfect for my one bedroom apartment. It fits right under my couch when not in use. One thing to note is that if you have any other remote and you change the volume on that remote it will change the speed of the treadmill. Now that I know that it is no big deal, but I thought it was broken when it would randomly change speeds.
This is the perfect treadmill for my size. I'm 5'4" and 154lbs and it seemed very easy to walk and run on the first few times I used it. My right side is heavier which causes the belt to slowly shift to the left so I had to make a few adjustments as per the instructions, however the belt moved better when walking on it at 3mph verses just running the belt after each adjustment. I love that it's not a huge treadmill that takes up space in my small house and it'll be easy to put it out of the way when necessary.
Well I really wanted to like this but it's pretty frustrating when it arrives and the remote doesn't work at all. I removed the insulation paper and I double checked that the battery was there but the remote still doesn't work. I'm assuming it needs a new battery but why would I get a product and have to replace the battery before I even use it once?
At first it wouldn't turn on and once I read the directions, magic lol. I like it because it's quiet, handles my weight and although compact large enough. I only walk and it seems perfect for my needs. If something happens I'll update but I'm happy right now!! Going to get this pandemic weight to go away!! Work off my anxiety ! I'd buy again.
I like that it was already assembled. It is exactly what I needed. A treadmill that I can use and then easily roll it in the corner. It works great and the instructions are simple to read. Just make a note the switch to turn on is under the treadmill near the cord.
This by far is my favorite home gym equipment. It is so easy to set up and compact. It fits anywhere and easy to move around. I love how quiet it is and it doesn't wake up my babies when I am using it at 5 am. I love it and recommend it to my friends and family all ready. I'm seriously thinking of getting another one for my sister. Thanks for making something so simple yet easy to use on a day to day basis. Get machine overall!
Arrived on time, no assembly, used it within 15 minutes of unpacking. Very quiet. So glad I decided to get it. I love it.
Very happy with this purchase. It's low profile and easy to move (has wheels). I slide it under the couch when not in use and it's quiet enough that I don't need to turn up the tv while using. Seems quite sturdy, very pleasantly surprised with the build quality.
I was nervous about shipping, but it arrived perfect. The packaging was great, well protected & yet easy to open & unload. There is no assembly & with the wheels it was easy to move to its new home, plug in & go. I've only used it once as it arrived today, but it's quiet, smooth & works as described. The easy of use will make this a great addition to my daily fitness routine!!!
This treadmill works great! It's easy to use and I love that it can easily be stored out of sight!
I love this treadmill. It's all we need.we don't need the fancy stuff that occupies the whole room. Perfect for our needs.
Have had this for over a month now and it gets about 1-2 hours of use everyday. No issues at this time. light weight, compact - but not too small that my 5' 10" husband can't run on it. Speed is good for any variation of walking, jogging or running that I am able to do. It is also quiet enough that I can jog in the room next to my toddler and not wake her up. Great for the price point.
"I bought this because I work seemingly every day and so being home and being with my family and staying fit are two things that are the most important to me. It's perfect for throwing on weighted vest or sauna suit and walking for an hour while watching tv or talking with the family. It's quit and easy to move.
My only thing I would change is the length of the cord and maybe an incline option."
The treadmill arrived on Monday and both of my kids have used it numerous times. It is small enough to slide under our couch, and the noise level during use is minimal. The treadmill is weighs about 50 lbs and with the two wheels on the front it is fairly easy to move around the house.
A very well 2 in 1 treadmill. It came in the box already assembled and ready to go. It is not too heavy but a bit hard to maneuver because rails do move and not completely locked down. I do smell some burning rubber smell while running and not quite sure if it's the oil burning or what. For the price, it's a great option to get some cardio and running in during this pandemic.
"Worked great right out of the box. My wife walked a mile immediately and it was great. I am a 200lb man and I jogged a mile. No issues and ran smooth. Folds down and slides under our bed easily.
For the money, this seems like a great buy."
My whole family enjoy the workout at home. It is compact and easy for storage when we don't need it.
Very Quit even when going fast! As well as very simple to to put away and bring out to use. Fits easily under bed or behind a couch!
Just what we were looking for in our tiny apartment.
Product shipped and was received in a timely manner. Easy to set up and use! Slides under the bed easily. The instructions don't mention the power switch on the right side under the cord - has to be switched on to operate. Otherwise, great sturdy product! I'm pleasantly surprised
This is the BEST Amazon purchase I have EVER made to date!!! Just what I was looking for to help my weightloss journey!!
So far so good. Treadmill works fine, very easy to setting up. I am using this treadmill with my standing desk and is working very well.
Wanted this treadmill to put away after usage under the couch and this machine fit the bill. Unboxed quickly, had it running in 5minutes. The only thing i wish it had was a pause but it works great so far! Very happy to this point.
No rebate given
I love this treadmill, I received it sooner than it was said to arrive, I pulled it from the box, plugged it in and I started walking!
Expensive but not good..
Great product, highly recommend!!!
Great machine, compact, lightweight and easy to use!! assembly is pretty much done already in the box!
Compact size is great. Very low noise level. And its nice to have both a remote as well as controls on the unit bar. Some of the other treadmills out there only have a remote only.
We first tried to buy a NordicTrack but they couldn't deliver it to our apartment. It wouldn't have fit anyway given its size. This fit perfectly in our apartment!
Small enough for a small space without compromising power. Great buy to get through the cold winter months with gyms still closed.
Great product, shipped to home in about a week. Easy set up right out the box and is portable enough to move around my small apartment. Recommended!
Perfect for my limited space. Works great and I can even run on it.
Good product, I have been using it for a week now. Using it during my work calls as a under-desk treadmill. So far ¦great!
It's perfect for an apartment. Easy to store and use. Definitely recommend buying for at-home workouts.
I've had it for 20 days. I've been running on it regularly at ~10 minute per mile pace. Nothing's gone wrong yet!
shockingly well built, quiet, and a joy to set up. Make sure you crank the belt tight and you are ready to rock
No assembly needed , arrived in great condition and packaged very well! Loved the product !!
Just plug in and turn the switch on and go. I am very happy with this purchase.
Just what I was looking for.
It's easy to use and it's a breeze to set up, quality product 10/10
Great customer service. Product is working well
Very nice product if you are limited on space and money.
It is good quality portable treadmill.
Great treadmill, easy to use!
"This little treadmill is much better than we expected for the price. Fairly lightweight, easy to move around, good features. But the instructions leave a bit to be desired (poorly translated and missing information), and we had trouble with the handle coming loose.
The main power switch is on the bottom of the machine, just behind where the cord is attached. This is not mentioned in the instructions. Besides that, the operation is fairly intuitive.
The belt was slipping a bit, but that was easily tightened with the included allen wrench. Adjusting and tightening the belt WAS well covered in the instructions.
The bigger issue (see pics) is the handle. When the handle is up, it is secured by locking tabs, but isn't held tightly. It moves front to back by almost an inch. One side of the handle came completely loose from the machine while i was using it, which could have been dangerous. The nut connecting the bar to the base (the hinge part - see pics) had come loose. This was easy to fix, but it's also something that shouldn't need fixing. The cover on the outside of the hinge has to be removed in order to access the nut, but it isn't easy to get off. I removed it by using a suction cup to pull it off. The nut just screws on, but apparently wasn't tightened properly at the factory. The nut has an odd shape to it, but I was able to use needle nose pliers to tighten. After fixing the side that came detached, i checked the other nut and it too was loose. After tightening, the bar is much less wiggly and feels far more secure.
It would be helpful if the cover to the hinge was easier to remove, and if they provided a tool for tightening this, and instructions about keeping this tight. Or find a better way to connect the bar in the first place. I can imagine many people just returning the machine due to this issue.
If not for the handle issue and the poor instructions, this would be a 5 star review."
This treadmill holds my weight (210 lbs) well and fits well under my adjustable desk so I'm able to walk while on conference calls. Would highly recommend it! I researched several before choosing this model and I'm happy with my choice.
"First of all, this is my first and only treadmill of this kind, so I can only review what I feel about this one. I don't know how it compares to others.
I waited to write this review as I wanted to use it for a few weeks to give an honest opinion.
The machines I am used to running on at the gyms are commercial grade and those cost thousands, so when I saw this for $400, I was expecting half the quality.
There are sooo many models on Amazon and I had no idea which was good, so I went with this one, because the lowering of the hand rail was easy. You just turn the little lever and it goes down (video shows it).
When I got the machines, it was a a bit heavy, but manageable. I was shocked there was REALLY NO ASSEMBLY!! I just propped up the hand rail and added oil and it was ready to be used.
The manual said to add about 10 ml. prior to use. The bottle does not come with markings, so how is one to know how much is 10 mL?... Anyways, I just added almost 1/4 the bottle. The machines is easy to operate, speed increments (+,-) by 0.2 increments. Stop Button and Pause, Emergency Stop.
Warning is that when ""paused"", the unit will stop, but when you ""resume"", it will pick up at the speed you have ""paused' at, so if you have it a full speed, be careful.
The machine is super smooth at low and high speeds. It does have sounds, but so do machines at the gym. But it's pretty decent - not very loud.
The only thing I have to caution is the ramp width is not very wide, which is great as it saves space, but if you are a taller/wider individual it might be tight.
I love this machine and highly recommend it. It is ultra smooth and compact. Perfect for homes of any size. Perfect for any condition the person is in. You can walk at speeds of 3.0 mph or run at 7mph. Perhaps the next model, they can have the option of raising the ramp."
This 2 in 1 desktop treadmill is very convenient to use. It doesn't need to install. It can be used after unpack the package. This treadmill can be placed under the bed without taking up too much space. It is easy to move with two front wheels. You can move easily when you lift the back. The front LCD displays time, calories, speed and distance with big size numbers, easy for read. There are speed adjustment button on the assist bar, plus button and Minus sign increase and decrease the speed about 0.2 miles, also number 3 and 6 buttons speed up the treadmill to about 3 and 6 miles per hour. Pause and start buttons on the assist bar. When you feel dangerous, you can press the big emergency pause button. The treadmill stops immediately. This treadmill can support people weighing 265 pounds. The treadmill also has a wireless controller. You can hold the controller to control the speed of the treadmill at any time. The treadmill with non slip running belt and silica gel column support will greatly absorb the vibration, it is very comfortable to run, and the muscles of the legs will not feel too much pressure. This treadmill has all the functions you need to use.
I purchased it because I had this brand bicycle before. It looks pretty, and high quality! The treadmill works just as well as normal treadmill! I bought this so i could walk at home during isolation of covid 19. Luckily this treadmill was good choice cause i can store this under my desk. It takes up little space and it is the best treadmill for small room. So far so good! I will update the review after a month!
I purchased this treadmill for my bf to exercise during this pandemic and he loves it! It is fairly small in size and it has wheels for easy moving and storage. Despite the small size, it's actually quite stable as you can see in the video. With the handle bar going up, you can run at the speed of 6mph without any issues. The buttons are easy to use, with the safety stop button in the center. The cell phone holder is a great added functionality for this model. Good value for the money spent on this.
"Just what we were looking for. A low profile treadmill that would be easy to store so it wouldn't have to become a permanent piece of furniture in our living room. It is super quiet and tracks your distance, time, and calories burned.
Two things to note-
1- There is a power switch you must turn on before use that is located on the bottom of the unit!!!! I spent over an hour trying to figure out why it wouldn't turn on then finally I decided it was a lemon and lifted it up to put it back in the box. That's when I discovered the switch. There is no mention of it in the instructions...
2- It has a remote that seems to be on the same frequency as my Roku tv remote. So when I turn my TV on, the treadmill turns on too. Not a big deal but just something to note."
During the covid-19,I have been working from home and can't go to the gym to exercise. Then I can only buy a small treadmill to pass my boring time. This treadmill is very nice and very small. Installation is also very simple, very suitable for people like me who have a small room and want to exercise at home. Can I walk while working, and can I put it under the bed when I don't need it? It is equipped with a small remote control. This is very helpful. I can easily increase or decrease the speed. When you run on it, it is noisy but acceptable because the price is perfect.
My boyfriend bought this for my birthday. I will definitely bring it to my workplace. I don't like to sit and type the computer every single day. I hope it could help me loss weight. It is a pretty and small one. Easy to bring every where I think. I wanted to share this unboxed video with you and I will update my experience with this little friend!!!
We have been looking for a treadmill since most people are now doing workouts in the house now due to covid 19. This is very easy to assemble and the price is reasonable for us. It has different speed levels also. It works as good as those that is over a thousand dollar. I would rather get this as it takes up less space. Overall would recommend
"Beautiful treadmill, compact in size.
Order on January 14, 2021, delivery on January 17, 2021
Colour: Black
I just installed a treadmill, and walking indoors (C0VID) will be a pleasure, and I find that I use it every day. Easy to set up, but a bit heavy when removed from the box. I really like black (my favorite), I told you it is compact, semi-compact, and very suitable for my living room. The remote control is also great."
Great little treadmill ! Just received it and am very excited to use it . It is very good quality , is not cheaply made . It's very compact, seems like it would fit under any couch or bed which is exactly what I was looking for . If you're looking for a folding treadmill I'd recommend looking into this one .
Treadmill was as described. It's easy to use and move (as soon as you know where the power switch is). I weigh 218 and it felt sturdy at about 3.2 mph. I'll try higher when I'm in better shape. So far so great.
I was looking for a space saving product that could also meet my daily need. I work at home for almost a year and really need some indoor exercise. But my office was not very big, especially with lots of my work materials and files. I normally put it under my desk, when I use it, simply pull it out. I have been use it for half month. It works well for me so far.
"It took almost a week to arrive. Honestly, this treadmill is extremely easy to set up. It is able to be neatly stored under the loveseat when not in use and fits under my desk when I want to walk and work.
The treadmill is smooth and quiet while running. But it is only fit for average body weight. It is not good for person who is over 200lbs."
"Good customer service. I put wrong address. The seller mail me another one to correct address. Thank you for helping.
For the product. No need installation,but need put grease oil in before use it. Very quite. Easy to bend and put it under sofa."
Compact and well-built. Great for underdesk or standalone setup. Happy with the purchase. Not a deal breaker but I could have used a longer power cord.
I love that there's no set up involved. It tucks behind our couch and works perfectly. Can't beat the price, we are happy with the purchase.
I really like this treadmill! Easy to use and storage, help me save a lot of space! Also the remote is good for control !
Nice treadmill for the money. I recommend it
This is a great treadmill. I highly recommend it. It is super easy to setup and put away. There is no assembly. It arrived early. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.
Excellent product
Treadmill came yesterday, and it was well packaged, looks good, was easy to set up, and worked well right out of the box... Hoping the initial goodness continues...
I wish it went faster for running but I love it! Perfect for speed walking and getting moving in your home!
"I purchased this for daily walking since I have a baby and it's hard to leave the house. I'm 5'3 and it works perfectly for me. My husband is 5'9 and he also has walked on it without issues. I primarily use this for walking and a run here and there.
Pros:
1. compact and easy to move around. It's set up in my living room but can easily put it away in the closet if needed.
2. setup is a breeze. You just pull it out of the box and attach the cellphone holder and arms. I didn't attach the arms incase I need to put this away.
3. digital screen. You don't need to worry about the remote being lost and you can start/stop the machine. Just a note, the buttons do not all work. Only the start/stop and speed + - work. The 1234567789 just light up to indicate which speed your at.
4. comes with 2 bottles of lubrication so you don't need to purchase any.
Cons:
1. belt pulls/skips when walking at lower speeds. As long as I walk over 4.5 I don't feel it as much. I have lubricated and adjusted the belt but it still does it. Have read this is an issue on the other model without the lcd screen.
2. power cable is short. I had to attach an extension cable so I could have it facing my tv in the living room not a huge deal but something to note if you don't want to be near the corner or wall.
3. count accuracy seems off. Everything is in km so I use my iwatch to keep track of my miles, steps, heart rate, etc. The calories on the treadmill vs. my iwatch are different so I don't think the treadmill is accurate. If this is something you want to keep track of I would invest in a watch or calorie counter.
4. Speed + - makes a beep sound as it goes up/down. Again, not a big deal but can be annoying when your trying to get to a high speed. Volume cannot be adjusted.
Overall, this treadmill is great for home use. I've used this 5x a week for the last month and so far no issues. If this review was helpful pls hit the helpful button and I will update my review after a few months.
UPDATE 12/26:
My treadmill still works well after all these months. The only other thing I've noticed is the there's no way to turn off the Bluetooth that links to the speakers. I've at times forgotten to turn off the treadmill and randomly someone who is walking by my house or neighbors (not sure who) syncs to it and it randomly plays whatever they are listening to. I've had a couple wtf moments when it suddenly starts and I'm not in the room, on the treadmill itself listening to music through my headset or I'm watching tv when it suddenly starts."
"Overall, I like this treadmill, and this is coming from someone who has owned a treadmill before. My old treadmill was clunky and loud. I am very happy that this machine is the opposite of that.
I would say that this treadmill is compact without being too compact. You won't be lifting this thing over your head, but it's still relatively light, and it has wheels on the front so you can roll it around.
The speed (7.5mph) and belt width (16in) are good. If you're in the market for a treadmill, I wouldn't get one with less than this. A 16in belt width is in my comfort zone.
As others have said, the siderails do NOT fold. If you choose to use them then you'll have to remove them if you want to fold the treadmill up. Personally, I don't need siderails. They get in the way, especially if you want to run with dumbbells.
All-in-all, I like that this is a respectable treadmill that is quiet and light and has a small footprint, being easy to fold up and put away. I should also mention that there was no assembly required, which is always a positive in my book.
Now for the negative bit. The control panel is coming off on one side. The treadmill arrived that way. I assume this is due to damage during transport. It's nothing that a bit of glue can't fix. The panel looks like it was glued in place to begin with, and the panel still works fine, so I'm not too worried about it. But, I thought I'd mention this in case it becomes a problem later. For now, the panel snaps back in place with little fuss.
Another issue though is the awful English grammar in the instructions. Really? The manufacturer couldn't find a single person with English as a first language to proofread the instructions? Some of the instructions and warnings are actually hard to understand because if the terrible wording and sentence structure. For example, I had trouble understanding where to add the lubricant to the treadmill. The poor instructions are accompanied by the worst smallest, blurriest picture ever. It could have been a picture of Sasquatch for all I know. All I could make out was a hand.
When I finally figured out what the instructions meant to say. I felt under the treadmill on the inside of the belt to see how lubricated it was. It was bone dry. So, I applied a liberal amount of lubricant to the inner belt and found that the treadmill ran much smoother and quieter than before, not that it was loud in the first place.
To anyone purchasing this treadmill, apply the lubricant that comes with the machine immediately. I count this as a negative to the manufacturer. Come on manufacturer! You couldn't spare a bit of lubricant before you shipped the product? It would keep the machines working more smoothly for longer and cost next to nothing. It would probably even help keep warranty costs down. This seems like an oversight.
I give this 4 starts because it IS a good treadmill for a budget buy. I would probably recommend this to others, but I'd keep some of the negatives in mind."
I'm 5'8 so I was worried the track would be too short, but it is plenty big. And it folds compactly to fit between my washer/dryer in my laundry room. I took away one star because you can't fold it if the arms are attached, and you can only adjust the speed by using the +/- buttons”you can't click on your desired speed. Also, be advised that speed and distance are listed in KM, not miles. Overall, I'm happy with the size and ability to stow away!
"I've been debating the purchase of a treadmill for years and with the pandemic and things closed I decided to go for it. Sooooo happy I got this. I've only been using it a day so far and will update if things go wrong but this thing is super easy to setup! As a big girl ~ 250lbs I was worried about this not working well for me but completely smooth.
Definitely grease the belt after setting up! It wasn't bad without but as others said the treadmill is dry when it arrives."
I was hesitant at first do to the small compact nature of the product and weight limit. I weigh 280 lb and am 5'11. The treadmill works perfectly thus far, off course so far what I Use it for is fast pace walking. Once I lower my weight I will try jogging on it. Its sturdy and semi heavy. Fits under my bed or behind my door. I would define it recommend for small indie spaces.
I love the treadmill! It is compact, and works well. We receive the machine yesterday and quickly put unpacked it and set it up to use! We loved it is quiet perfect for an apt. I packed 9k steps this morning. Very happy with that. The only issue is the installation of the side holders! It is poorly designed! You did jot get 5 starts because that design is horrible. It took us 45 minutes attempting to put the screws trough those tiny holds. The screws are too short. We were only able to do 3 in 45 minutes! What a terrible design.. you need to fix that! Other than that, I love the machine. Thank you.
"We like this treadmill. It was easy to assemble the three parts needed-to finish assembly. The treadmill (tho ) came assembled out of the box. This was a great feature. It ran excellent and everything worked. It is also very quiet.
I will highly recommend to buy."
The treadmill runs very smooth, looks nice and the controls are simple. I had no idea the handlebars extended (not in the manual) and I was about to send the thing back. They still aren't ideal - too large and smooth for a real solid grip but manageable for my needs. The folding handle that locks the riser in place is a bit of a bear to fold down - I have to adjust the tension each time I use it. And I have to take the handlebars off if I want to fold it down a bit annoying but worth it.
Not much to assemble, easy to use. The equipment not light, roughly 75lb, front has wheels. Min-Max Speed: 1-12km/h, equal to 0.6-7.4 miles/h. As I have knee pain, thus I only use it for 30min once a week at walking speed 3km/h, about 1.8m/h.
"I will summarize my experience as follow:
PROS:
1. It is compact, great size for small places.
2. Easy to assemble and to move around If needed.
3. Great speaker...to the point my husband said wow you bought a speaker and you can even walk on it! Lol! The sound is really amazing and you connect it via Bluetooth to your phone.
4. It does the job, you can have a decent jog, I had ran on it for over 30 min and it works ok. It is easy to use for anyone in your family.
5. Overall I think it is a good investment if you are planning to use it to complement your workout routine, or if you do not workout at all and you are planning to start moving. Not really for athletes, but it is ok as I am not one! ;-)
CONS:
1. Definitely the monitor that tracks milage, calories, etc is off with the measurements. To give an example, on average I jog/run for 40 min on speed 5-6 on a normal treadmill and it is over 300 calories, here the same time and speed then marks a little over 100 calories.
2. For walking and jogging is ok but if you are planning to run, then it feels a little unstable, it wiggles on the upper part but it is safe.
3. The velocity goes up to 12; however 12 in this machine is not near to what 12 is in a normal gym type treadmill, I am totally unable to run at 12 in a normal treadmill, here a 12 feels like the equivalent to maybe 6-7.
4. You cannot pause your workout and pause your progress , if you stop it then when you go back everything resets and it starts from zero.
5. If you are tall probably this may not be a good fit for you(Check on the measurements that they provide). My husband is 6' and he needs to be careful to do small steps as the base is not long enough for him but for me, it is perfect, I am 5'4 and I can go fast on it without worrying about the length of my steps.
6. There is no incline functionality.
In conclusion, I do like this product to keep me active at home and I do not regret the purchase at all but it will not replace a more advance treadmill if that is what you are looking for."
"I received today July 13,2020 this product I order last July 6, 2020. Product was deliver via FedEx which1 is great because I saw how it was delivered in front of our apartment and they are carefull since I did not see any damage when I opened the product itself, everything is intact.
The box is heavy for 1 person so i need my bestfriend to able to get it inside the apartment.
Treadmill is 49 inches long and 22 inches wide.
It was a go plus with handle touch in monitor for start/stop ,speed +/-.
Assembles easily since the handle is already fix, only handle bar and cellphone holder.
The Kit complete with 2 bottle of silicone oil for treadmill and tools for fixing screws and adjusting the belt also with remote control if you want since it had small touch screen so I rather use it.
Happy to run and walk again for an hour even I don't go outside or go to the gym (which I missed since this pandemic started).
Go for healthy heart!!
Anytime I could use this treadmill since it is not that noisy unless you run for faster speed like 8 and above.
No bad comments yet since I just started only today after I unbox it."
For me, as a mom of two. There's no time to go to the gym and either go outside alone. It's good to have this treadmill for people and women like me. It works good and it doesn't take to much space. I don't have to much space where I live, so I thought this was going to be the best for me and it didn't thought wrong. :) I'm happy with my electric treadmill. I wake every morning to do my cardio and exercises while the girls sleep.
When the world shifted to virtual meetings from home, I needed a way to not sit because sitting hurts my back. This treadmill makes a great treadmill desk (though it is not officially certified for putting a desktop on). It is compact, quiet, looks neat in my home office and easy to operate. I placed an unused Ikea shelf (just a single shelf with the cross-bar underneath), and it works great! LOVE IT!
The treadmill I received has several rather large gashes in the side. Normally I would return it but times aren't normal right now. I was unable to attach the arms although I am usually pretty handy and I can't lock down the bar which goes up and down ”it's impossible to do. However the machine is useable without those. So you can just plug it in and use it which I need during the pandemic. It isn't very noisy but it has an irritating repetitive low pitch sound like ah-ah-ah-ah. Also it's not smooth”another reviewer mentioned this is the belt slipping which sounds like what this feels like. It's still useable though. Despite its limitations, it suits my purposes which is just to walk”like 3.5mph ”for a few hours a day while watching TV ”and it works fine for that. Oh”and you can't fold the bar down if you put the arms on. since I can't get them on anyway, it's not an issue right now but that would be very annoying if you need the handles and want to put the bar down after use (which I do). In sum, it's handy, small, and works well enough
This product is fantastic it is very lightweight but yet sturdy enough to run on if you want to i use it every day it runs very smoothly and quietly I have a feeling I made a very good purchase in getting this treadmill. I actually look forward to using it every day
"So..I purchased the first treadmill in July 2020. The treadmill started squeeking within 30 days. I contacted the manufacturer because the distributor does not handle issues (Costway) via email. Email is their only method of contact. It took 2 weeks of conversation to figure out that they were not going to replace the product. The requiest that I unscrew the treadmill covering over the motor; however, that covering is screwed in incredibly tightly and a battery operated screwdriver could not get the screws to loosen. The treadmill has since slowly started dying. The motor squeeks; the bearings seem to be going out; and the drive belt is already worn. It will take $150 just for a treadmill repair person to evaluate the issues.
I decided to give the company another chance because I thought some of the issues with the treadmill might have been caused by me. I purchased a second one and I sold the last one to a friend for a very small amount of money with the honest assessment that it might not last more than another 3 - 6 months (at the most). The second one arrived today and has a display issue (please see the attached picture). After walking on it for about 10 minutes to see any other flaws: 1. The clock loses time. I use my iPhone stopwatch since I cannot rely on the display timer. I also supposedly walk at a 5.4 pace. I have never done this at any gym treadmil. So...the information provided by the display is inaccurate. I thought this was a problem with the original because of the motor, but on day 1, it's also a problem with the new one. I purchased it to use with my standing desk and it will require me to lower the arms, which in turn caps the speed at 4.0. So, to use it with my desk, I am going to have to walk slowly, I guess.
This company does not have good quality control and Costway (the distributor) does not stand by their products and offer replacements. The manufacturer will probably want me to take apart the display to fix it myself (based on the previous conversations about the last treadmill). Because of the type of product, Amazon does not take returns on this product. So, if you plan on purchasing from this company, be aware that you may be throwing away $500.
So... as a followup, the third-party seller did request me to replace the display myself. I contacted Amazon and I also reported the seller."
"Very quiet and compact. Looks sleek and modern. It warns you before the belt starts. It slows down before stopping too.
Now comes the shortfalls.
The phone holder up top is flimsy. It looks like an afterthought. The two arms were difficult to install. There's no guide pin to hold anything in place. The bolts were short and you have to screw them in by feel while holding the arm on the other side. The number indicators are neat but they can't be used to adjust the speed. There's no mounting slot for the remote control either. I ordered a green one but it came in black. I bought the extended warranty from Asurion and it was supposed to be delivered by email but nothing showed up.
There were scuff marks on the end caps that used to be black but are now white. This machine looks to be worth $300 not $400"
I am about 2 weeks in so far and this treadmill has done the trick. I walk a few hours on it each day, which is great as being stuck in the house was killing my fitness. I have not used it to run, nor ever turned it on with the handlebars up. I wish the walking speed would go a bit faster (with the handlebars down, max speed is 4 km/hr) for the few moments that I want to really walk fast. Note, it is more than fast enough. At the highest speed you really can not type more have an easier conversation.
It arrived very quickly! Sadly, it arrived with cracks and scrapes. I think this is a good purchase for "beginner" exercisers (like me)! I like that it's small and portable. It's super cute! Best if you're interested in taking brisk walks or light jogs!
Beware of this product! This freakin' treadmill keeps on decelerating while in use. It won't last a mile & will shut down automatically. It's either over heating or the motor itself is a piece of crap! Bought this to relieve my stress through running. But it's the other way around. Don't be deceived by its looks. DO NOT BUY THIS TREADMILL!
"First treadmill especially for stay at home order. At first I want bowflex but the price and you cannot put it away like this one. Although it say 75lbs but it seem heavy but maybe because my apartment used rug. No assemble is needed since I did not put on the handle but not as quiet as I thought.
The seller increase prices everyday since the delivery price going up. Prices did go up before all my Amazon gift card arrived. I saw it as deal of the day few days later, I contact the seller, he is willing to issue partial of price difference which is better than nothing."
"Just assembled mine and it works fine so far if you follow these steps:
1. Plug in to power outlet and switch the power button.
2. You'll see E07 error because you haven't attached the safety lock (a lot of reviews complain about this...not sure if they tried to attach the safety lock before declaring the machine a lemon). Attach it now.
3. Start the treadmill by either pressing start on the remote OR the touch screen. (Huge advantage over this similar product which relies solely on the remote and would no longer function if you were to lose it.)
4. You'll probably notice some slipping of the belt when you first try walking on the treadmill.
a) Take out the two bottles of lube included in the package. Lift up the belt and apply the lube (watch a youtube video for more details). The belt should be very easy to lift up because it was intentionally loosened for shipment.
b) Tighten the belt using the allenwrench provided, turning half a rotation on each side and alternating until the belt is tight enough that the slipping goes away."
So so, for the price is pretty decent, but the faceplate is coming apart from the front, it doesn't affect the performance but it is a pain. The belt is also sliding to the side, which we've tried to fix and haven't figured it out. I use it for walking, but my husband wanted to run. With the belt the way it is, it keeps moving when he tries to run. Small and quiet, but has a bump that makes is higher than 5 inches. We were hoping to slide it under the couch when not using, but that makes it impossible.
I've had this treadmill for exactly one month and use it for 30 minutes every day, no problems. Arrived extremely well packaged and easy to assemble. Getting the bottom right lever to flip up and hold the riser in place took a few minutes, but finally resolved. You do need to remember this isn't a heavy-duty gym-grade treadmill, it's meant for home spaces. I can stretch up to 5'2" and the belt is perfect for me at a good walking pace. Would not recommend for a tall person or someone who wants to run, the belt is just not long enough. The side handlebars are nice but don't grip and pull up on them, that could unbalance the treadmill. And once you install the side handlebars, I don't see that you're going to routinely remove them to fold up the treadmill, it's really meant to just stay in place where you locate it in your home, but there are rear wheels if you need to move. The holder for phone is fine but don't expect it to support an iPad. I don't use the remote to adjust speed, only use the display buttons on front panel. Yesterday I adjusted the belt since it started to deviate a little to the left, but adjustment with supplied Allen wrench was easy, took about 2 minutes, read the instructions and there are plenty of YouTube videos if you want more guidance. Two lubricating bottles are included, so far after one month I have not needed to use. It may sound like I'm giving some negatives--not really, it's a great treadmill for the price. I just want people to realize it's meant for the home and shorter people who walk not run.
It doesn't work! I immediately received a error message about the motherboard once plugged in. Now what? How does one repack this monster once it's taken out!?
I got everything up and running within 2 minutes of opening the box. Very easy to fold up and down. I am not installing the side arm things because they make it so you can't fold it up....I'm totally fine without the side arms. I will say that this device wouldn't be good for anyone taller than, or with a longer stride, than I have. I am 5'9" with short legs and I take up all the running space, occasionally slightly hitting the back of the treadmill. My husband (6'0") can't run on it due to the small surface area, although he can walk on it. One other consideration, everything is in metric and isn't really accurate at that. I've tested it out with several stride measuring devices and, as other reviewers have mentioned, it's not entirely right. Probably +/- 20%. I don't really care about that though. All in all, I'm glad I bought it - it's perfect for me, was a good price, and hides away easily.
It runs. That is about all I can say. It is very cheap, the remote stopped working after 2 days. You can start and stop and increase speed. The speed is no accurate. They are increasing the price because people are stuck at home and so obviously they want to stay active. At best, this thing should cost 99 bucks. If you need to move.. go for it, but it is super cheap in quality and doesnt even have basic features like pause.
Not only did this product not work, parts were peeling off because the glue was not sturdy enough. Also, it's suggested to contact the seller before returning, but there is no point in wasting your time contacting them. They did absolutely nothing to fix the problem. They only told me the obvious, which was to return it.
"This treadmill arrived earlier this week and so far, so good. I like how compact it is. It's much smaller than the previous one that I ordered from a different company (that one was defective so I returned it and ordered this one). However, that said: I'm 5'2 and if I was taller than 5'4 I'd be concerned about the ramp being too short. So there are trade offs to the compact size, I suppose.
I really liked how easy it is to set up. Extremely intuitive and simple. I also like that there's a handheld remote option and an option to use the control panel.
I'm happy with this purchase overall and I've been using this treadmill immediately (great sign). Thank you."
Belt is hardly moving, as soon as we understood there is not a fix wanted to return it, but instead got a reply from the seller telling us to lubricate under the belt which looks like it is mispositioned too. Never buy from this seller, it is only look nothing else.
It arrived earlier than expected. It was an easy set up straight out of the box. The one side was a bit scuffed from travel I assume. The one issue i have is a clicking/ knocking sound and have no way to contact the company to either fix or replace! I have no idea what I am supposed to do at this point! I cannot use it while it is malfunctioning. HELP!!!!!!!
Mine was very weak at first until it was extremely lubricated. Even then, you can hear the strain under each step. After just a week or so, the motor started whining. After 3.5 weeks, it began randomly making a very loud squeeling sound that would persist for at least 30 seconds. I'm assuming the motor was going bad already, so I went ahead and returned it. I bought another goplus model, but i'll be returning it as well for other issues. I'd steer cleer of these cheap brands and go for something like a lifespan treadmill at a minimum
I purchased this primarily for walking not running. The package arrived and it looked like it went through a war zone, fortunately the only damage was on the bottom cover of the motor not a big deal it didn't affect the operation and you can't see it. Worked great for 2 weeks then started getting this horrible squealing noise. Reached out to customer service and they got right back but weren't too much help. Since I didn't feel like shipping this thing back I removed the top motor cover and find out its coming from the belt pulley, turns out one of the motor mounting bolts was never tightened down so the pulleys were out of alignment, once I tightened it the noise went away. Would've given 4 stars but subtracting 1 star for poor quality control and needing to do my own repairs after 2 weeks. BTW you'll need metric allen keys to tighten the motor bolt.
It's exactly what I've been looking for.. it's small, not too heavy, I can fold it, store it.. not under my couch unfortunately its 1/2 an inch too big... I only have 2 complaints.. I like the handle bars, but you can not fold the treadmill with them attached.. so.. sacrifice falling for folding.. okay my second complaint is the display screen was lifted off its place. It was almost hanging off, I can see the springs behind the screen, hate to damage that. Even when I stick it flush against the display area, it still lifts up.. should I super glue it or what? Almost makes me want to return it seriously.
"I should've listened to more of the reviews. This item is not Canadian or American made/distributed. After talking with amazon they investigated and found out this seller is from China and attempting to imitate a Canadian seller. You're paying quality money for a clearly low quality item.
They physical issues I had with the item is that half of the ""buttons"" are misleading and do nothing. They are just lights with numbers or words over them. The handbook is in broken English with horrible photo guides. I followed all instructions and read the reviews on here for those who had help figuring it out and it still would overheat. The display is completely messed up and the timer is off. What I mean by that is I tracked it multiple times, the distance and time runs fast/slow. It said I ran 2 miles in 15 minutes, my fit bit and pedometer both said it was only 1.3 miles in 12 minutes.
Seller communication over all of this was very bad. First it took them a week after printing the label to even ship it. I'm located in WA and it was supposed to be coming from Canada yet they shipped it to GEORGIA and it took two weeks to get to me after all of that. Then there was shattered wood in the box that led to splinters in the box so I immediately had to throw away all of the packaging. After all of the issues with the item I asked to return it and the seller offered me $80 to keep it with no refund. I had to eventually file a claim through Amazon to which the seller begged me to remove the claim (mind you every email from them has a different name signed at the end) and offered me $160 and told me to go get it fixed locally. Finally Amazon just took care of it because the seller was not holding up their end.
Just save yourself the headache!"
Pretty great machine! Only had it for a few days so far but so far it is perfect for my needs. I like to jog (7 mph max) and this gets the job done. Love the controls on the front + the remote. It is narrow but doesn't bother me too much, I am 5 ft 3in 150 lbs”- so maybe not the same for a bigger or taller person. My 6ft boyfriend jog on it just fine tho. All in all I love it. Keeps me from having to go outside during Covid !
I was very pleased when it arrived and easy to assemble. But after 4 uses it gave an error code and I have been back and forth with the company to try to come to a suitable resolution, it has taken almost a week and it's still not fixed
"I'm loving this little treadmill. It's great for walking while working or running or walking after hours. The size and convenience are great for a spare bedroom/ office area. The setup was a breeze. I've seen many folks comment on the error code when receiving their machine. They obviously didn't read the little pamphlet that came with the unit. This is the way it's supposed to work. Follow the quick instructions and you're good to go! I love the little remote control. It makes for easy modifications in on/off and speed. I was going to purchase a large standard treadmill but I'm so glad I didn't and that I found this machine. I've already all my friends, relatives and coworkers about it.
Wishes for couture improvements: that the small side arms would attached easier. I haven't used them to date because I'm not going to take the time to screw them in and out for a few minutes for treadmill use.
The length could be a few inches longer. It works fine for my height/ length legs however a few added inches could help folks with longer legs and allow a longer run stride.
Would be nice if the speed numbers on the panel worked so you could push the number and it would go to that speed."
It's ok but over priced for what it is. The safety key is very sensitive and get an error with the slightest movement. The side came cracked also. I found the same unit a $100 cheaper on the FB market place. After using it I don't like all of the noise it makes. The belt keeps slipping to the left. I got to say I am really upset with this unit.
Product arrived with a poorly assembled belt and frame. There was a large gap on one side, and on the other the belt went up next the plastic frame, which rubbed on the plastic frame, making a loud squealing noise. The instructions are hard to follow, and appear to have been poorly translated. After going through steps to realign the belt, the installation was just too far off to move. Small area to run/walk. Since our primary purpose for the treadmill is to use for running, going ahead and investing in a standard size treadmill.
Belt pauses on every footstep under 4kph, button panel coming off, weird oil smelling lubricant they provide, helicopter low-frequency noise when running after two weeks.
Received my Go Plus treadmill yesterday and had it assembled and lubricated in less than an hour. Bought this treadmill for two reasons: it folds flat to store under my sofa and reaches speed up to 7.5 mph. It delivered on both. I had to sell my Life Fitness treadmill when I moved into a small condo because it took up too much space. I was concerned about buying such a cheap replacement but it also delivered on sturdiness. I think it's worth mentioning I am a 115 lb runner (so I can't opine on how it would respond to a heavy runner pounding). I also like how easy it is to fold down and wheel under my sofa. I can also roll it under my standing desk. What I don't like about the Go Plus is that I need to lubricate the belt and the smaller deck size results in more thought about foot placement and stride length. I'm still pleased with my purchase. Great value at less than $500!
"I've been using this treadmill for about a month. I wanted something smaller than the normal treadmills that I could hop on in 15 min intervals throughout the day to break up my workday. Months of sitting at a computer 10 hrs a day for work really started making my back hurt and my body felt less active. I was looking to recreate the activity of a normal day in the real office.
I didn't put the handles on so that I could quickly pop it up and down if I wanted it to not be seen. I don't run on in but I do try to do a fast walk. The width is perfect for my plus size 5'3 frame but it is definitely more narrow than a pro treadmill at the gym.
I'm right at the max weight and hoping to take off some pounds.
The only annoying thing is that the remote sticks on increase and skips forward so you really have to be prepared to pick up your speed quickly. Always attach the safety plug for this reason. This is a remote problem and not treadmill problem. I probably need to contact the company to get a new remote."
Delivered, started using 29th September 2020. Used and enjoying it almost everyday until the belt started slipping from the roller or feels like its grabbing the deck and would stop abruptly, not good for the knee, oiled to no avail, did not fixed the problem/issues. It still turns on but problem still exist. Now its just one big paper weight and an obstruction in the garage, CANNOT RETURN IT. This is the only I can do. VENT MY FRUSTRATION AND HOPEFULLY MANUFACTURERS WILL SEE THIS AND REPLACE THEIR PRODUCT, I'M JUST STUCK WITH IT!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT AND PLS RECONSIDER OTHER MANUFACTURERS SINCE I'VE NOT HEARD FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE SINCE I EMAILED THEM THE SAID ISSUE(S)!
"Treadmill arrived. It was very heavy, had to get my son to help me bring it in and unbox it.
Assembly was mostly really easy. Yes, the manual is written by somebody for whom English is a foreign language, but it was understandable.
The handles are REALLY hard to attach--i will have to retry tomorrow, they are not even or tight. BUT, the good news is, I confirmed that the treadmill will operate in walking mode, if the main beam is folded down but can't be folded all the way because the handles are still attached. I want to be able to use it as a standing desk, but also as a treadmill, and that will work, as long as I don't remove the handles. You'd think they'd be able to come up with a design that would fold the handles without removing them, but for the price?? I am okay with it, as long as I can use it with a walking desk, without the pain of removing the handles every time."
Started coming apart with in 6 days. And belt began sliding. Spend the money if you want to have a nice, lasting piece of equipment.
After returning a unit from another brand, we decided that we need a unit compact and practical enough for rehab purposes. This was worth the money.
EDITED AFTER USE: Ugh it pauses /jerks when i change my pace even slightly . Makes me nervous that I will trip . Also belt was placed too far to left and rubs against frame I guess I will try and figure how how to fix I think this is the whining noise I was hearing off and on while walking . Initial impression : Great so far ! Can't believe how sleek and quiet yet sturdy it is ! So easy to get it up and running just pops open really . Only 4 stars because directions are not great , the one piece I need to really understand just so poorly written and described I will have to research myself . Re: tightening belt and lubricating. The Pictor is just of a hand
This is a very good treadmill and fits almost anywhere. I am over 6' and I can walk just fine on it. The weight capacity says 265 but I'm over 300 pounds and it works just fine for me. The motor gets a little hot even when my kids use it but never overheats. I can use it for hours at a time.
Because this product is not made in the United States, there is no 800 phone number to call if you have difficulties during assembly. Additionally, the instructions are written in a kind of twisted English, likely due to the fact that the product is manufactured in China. I had to email several times before I got a response and the response was so poorly written that it was of no help. Finally, I figured out something on my own, though I don't know if my workaround is any good. By the way, because there's no phone number, the company wanted me to email them a video. That just would make the communications process even longer! It's a decent product, but Lord help you if you need assistance.
I have very limited space, so I chose this treadmill over some others that were probably of higher quality because they did not fit the space. I knew before purchasing that this treadmill displayed the speed and distance in kilometers (km/h) instead of miles (mph). Another reviewer had mentioned the belt "skipping" and I have experienced this as well at around 4mph (6.4 km/h). I am 5'10" and 215lbs, and would recommend this for anyone at the same size or smaller, but probably not any taller due to the smaller size of the walking or running area. My personal stride is right at the cusp of what is comfortable on this particular treadmill. Assembly was quite easy with just myself, but it is a decievingly heavy item overall, and could be difficult to move by oneself. I run about 3-6 miles a day on it 5-7 days a week and have experienced no issues other that the periodic skipping, which might have to do with my current weight, but I do not know for certain. The belt came lubricated and basically ready to go once I put the arms on. Overall, I enjoy this treadmill and recommend it for the space savings. If you have more space and do not need it for the walking, under-desk ability, I suggest finding another of higher quality that you wouldn't have to make compromises that you do with the aforementioned issues or km/h conversion.
This treadmill is exactly as described. As long as you don't put the arms on, you can easily fold the bar down and store it under the bed or your couch, if your couch sits high enough. My couch, unfortunately, didn't have enough clearance. It's pretty heavy, but the wheels do make it easier to move. I'm 5'5" and 130lbs and, although I have a little trouble, I am able to move it from room to room. It runs great - very smooth. The speakers aren't anything special, but they are convenient. All in all, happy I bought it!
"Like so many others, due to Covid we've been trying to exercise at home. This treadmill is a great addition to the home. It's compact so it doesn't take up as much space. Unfortunately, this also means that we are prone to stepping on the side and losing our balance a bit. I find myself holding onto the wall for security. I'd like to put the handles on and hold there but then I would lose the easy ability to fold and put away treadmill. This is the one thing I wish was different. It's also a little heavier than I imagined to put away. It doesn't fit under my sofa, but if it did, it seems that it would be awkward and heavy to pull it out since the wheels are made for rolling lengthwise. The instructions could be written clearer (and in better English).
Anyway, a couple minor issues but otherwise I am very happy with my purchase."
"Update: after about a month of use, I'm having the same issues a few others noted, where the motor gets so hot it literally melts the bottom of my running sneakers. Everything else, minus melted shoes, has still been fine. But I don't want to have to buy shoes every few months because they melt, that cost would add up and negate the value of this treadmill. And the motor getting so hot, even after just 30 minutes of walking, has me seriously doubting the longevity of this item.
Original review: I was worried about some of the negative reviews but I must say, I'm totally impressed by this compact treadmill. Works great under my desk while walking, great while jogging and watching TV, and its relatively quiet. I did have the same issue of it feeling like it was getting ""stuck"" every other step, but that actually went away after about a week of use. My one piece of advice though: it's a serious gamble to buy this if you are over 5'6"". That's how tall I am, with stumpy legs and a short stride, and I think the length of the treadmill is precisely perfect for people my height or below. My boyfriend (5'11"") says he can walk on it, but he has to adjust his stride so it's not particularly comfortable. And I have no idea what the return process would be like if you decided you were too tall to comfortably use it. Short stumpy people like me are okay though. ðŸ‘"
"I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing. In response to some of the negative reviews, it was VERY easy to assemble. The only thing it requires is attaching the cell phone plate and the arms. I chose not to install the arms so I can easily fold it up and store it out of view if I wanted to. If you are worried about falling or need something to hold on to, you probably should install the arms so you can hold on. It is really your preference. But it is four bolts and super easy.
I did take the advice in other reviews and lubricated the belt out of the box. Based on the manual, it felt appropriately lubricated but I wanted to be sure. Regarding the belt, I feel that if I needed to make any adjustments, the manual gave easy instructions to follow for me to handle that myself.
It is a compact treadmill but perfect for my needs. It is quiet and runs great. No errors, no damage. I would agree that the distance tracker is off. It definitely tracks that I've walked farther than with other GPS trackers I use on trails (fitbit).
Overall, I'm very happy that I pulled the trigger and purchased. I would recommend to others."
"We were expecting a product that worked similarly to a gym treadmill. That's all we've ever used. This is not that. You get what you pay for. The running belt seems to lag or catch whether running or walking on it providing an uncomfortable exercise experience. We tried lubrication as well as adjustments to the running belt tightness. No improvement. I would not recommend this product.
That being said, I would like to point out the Goplus/Costway customer service was fantastic. They were very prompt in response to emails, provided us troubleshoot assistance, offered to pay an allowance for a technician to come look at it, and eventually provided complimentary return shipping and a full refund. I wish all online retailers provided this quality of service."
It's a nice treadmill and easy to hide, however two things: first, I wish it was packaged better. Treadmill arrived bit damaged. It doesn't affect on its run. I didn't return it simply because it can't fit into my car to take to closest UPS. Second, hard to explain but when I run with each step it's like pulling opposite side. It's distracting honestly.
"Purchased in December to walk indoors while working from home. I'm well under the maximum weight load and I only walked 3-5 km each day at 3-4 kmph. I never ran or went more than 10 km in a single day. It's too small to easily run on it anyways. The belt had to be nudged back to center every five minutes or so and it got warm and smelled like hot rubber after an hour or two, but it otherwise did what I need until just recently.
After just over a month it fails to startup. When I start the belt, it beeps and shows E02 on the display. The manual says this is caused by a ""power assault"" which will require ""replacement of electronic control""."
I love this! Now delivery could have been a little better there was a rip in the box and a dent in the unit but honestly didn't impact anything. You do have to make adjustments to the tread which after researching was very easy. So the weird noises or slipping are due to the fact YOU HAVE TO ADJUST/TIGHTEN the tread. You also have to oil it with the oil provided. It did take a couple times to adjust it perfect and I occasionally have to tighten but that's normal with any treadmill. This is a great value!! I walk and run on it! So glad a purchased it!
This does what I wanted it to do! Simple, easy to walk on (if you don't have a huge stride...I imagine that would be a challenge if you did) I had a bit of trouble getting it back to where it needed to be once I did what all the reviews said to do, which was use the lubricant. Honestly, if I could do it again, I would've started it up, made sure it worked, THEN went in with the lubricant. I made the belt WAYYYY too loose and had to fool around with it for a couple hours before I could use it again.
This mill has a smooth hum, no longer have to watch the weather, no more sun screen/hats. Its super sexy and streamline. I had a bulky, loud mill for 15 years, ran outside for 3 years, then this one came along. I would highly recommend and advise if you buy to lubricate the mill per the instructions. I put the lube on my hand, lifted the belt, on both sides and proceeded to smoosh the lube on the belt, not much tho. Good luck and happy running!
It has been well over a month since I purchase my fancy smart thread mill and I can now say that it was well worth it. I do my brisk walk on it twice a week and it has worked well each time. So easy set up, space saver and neat. I tucked it in under my bed after use and it's compact size fits very well while hidden. The Bluetooth option is great and the screen provides distance count, minutes of work out and calories burned. I'll do one hour at a time and take a rest and then do another one. This is not the typical gym threat mill so please don't try to do a marathon in it. Stability is the key. I'm very happy with this investment. Just make sure to take good care of it.
Unfortunately, this treadmill is not well made. We spent over an hour trying to understand the instructions that were filled with misspelled words and sentences that didn't make sense. We got it all put together and the top display screen wouldn't work. The treadmill would turn on but would only go 4 mph. We check all the wires and it looked like one of them had been damaged and hot glued back together. I think that explains why it didn't work. The size was perfect for me. I'm 5'2 and 120 pounds. It looked like it would fit nicely under our bed. The down side would be taking off the arm bars ever-time you wanted to store it away. The cord to plug it in is very short as well. I really wish it had worked. We sent it back for a full refund through Amazon.
"Best investment ever and fast delivery! Received it a few days earlier than expected. It comes with side handles and a cell phone holder. I opted not to use those though.
Tested it out and it's just like being at the gym but at home. It's very quiet and runs smoothly and light weight when moving I haven't tested out the speaker for music yet though but I wear my own headphones anyways."
"If I could give this negative stars. I would.
Making horrible noises. Smells like a dumpster fire. Code E05 came up and it doesn't work. This is before I even got to use the thing. I better get a refund."
Overall I like this product, I get good use out of it. I had two issues when I opened it.. one, the power cord is very short, making it inconvenient to position it. An extension cord fixed that. Second problem was a sensor moved out of place and pulled up an error code and it would not work until fixed.. luckily this problem is common enough that I found the solution on Amazon, but I did have to take it apart to get to the sensor and find a way to secure it. It wasn't difficult but since it was brand new I wasn't too happy
I purchased this because I wanted something light that I could move around. I also wanted something that was cost appropriate and wasn't going to break the bank. I received the item earlier than the predicted date, so that was a plus. It was all basically put together, you just had to attach the arms and phone bracket. The remote is nice for when the arms are down, and the small screen for when the arms are up is not an eye-sore. Overall, the only thing that I do not like is how the top is not very sturdy, but for the price it isn't something I would fret about.
This is a very good treadmill, but I have a few things to point out. First, I was walking at 5 km/h then every time I step, it goes backwards for a fraction of a second. Second, for every consumer, the E07 code is because you didn't put in the red thingy in the yellow slot below the speed controls. Third, The measures of speed is KILOMETERS not MILES. So if you wonder why you're going fast, that's why.
"Love that this was easy to assemble. Very convenient relatively light weight machine while still feeling sturdy. My only complaints are
1: it suddenly turns of by itself from time to time. Sometimes I'm on for 1 hour with no problem, but other times after 20 minutes or so of walking (at 2+ speed), the machine just stops. Ok to simple enough to start again, just annoying.
2: the remote stopped working after the 2nd day. I have to turn on and off manually."
"I like the treadmill. It's small and I can store it under my couch. I bought it because I caught COVID 2 months ago and it went crazy on my lungs and totally depleted my stamina. Getting to the point to walk in a store to get my groceries was hard. It has been good in helping with recovery.
What I don't like is the speaker. You cannot adjust the volume and it disconnects. When it disconnects and it lets out this really loud 'snow sound.'"
I ordered and received this treadmill in about 4 days. Unfortunately it. Arrived with the plastic frame cracked in several places. Inside of one week the company negotiated with me to see if I would accept a partial refund and keep it because it seemed completely functional. I chose to return it, and they did provide complete refund and return shipping. Loved the size and really wanted it to work, but did not feel good buying a new product that was broken. Look like many people have had no issues with shipping , but if you do, they handled it very well. I still wish it would have worked out for me. It was a great size and really rather cool looking.
I never write reviews..this is my first exception...I spent a lot of time checking these out...and I can confidently say ...this is a great treadmill...I purchased it for walking (I'm not a runner) during the winter months ...easy out of the box...screwdriver set up ...6 screws...quiet motor...important since I'm in a condo...2nd floor......compact size...easy to lubricate...stable platform...I bought the dark green as it doesn't draw attention to itself vs...silver...red...blue...etc...I've already recommended it to my brother.
I've had it for less than a week so I really can't rave over it. I like it's small size (one bedroom apartment). it is indeed sturdy, works well, and it is very pretty. Hope this helps with your decision.
Wooaahhh!!!!! I was not wrong when buying this product, is amazing. For me is perfect for my small space, is very sturdy and super easy to use. Very easy to assemble which is not much too!!. Would definitely buy again.
"I thought and hoped it will be good size for use but apparently it's way to small for a fast walk or run on it. It's maybe fit a small people/ ladies but for sure not for mid guys. Also it's really noisy! Not sure is that's only in my situation m, maybe it's defective or it's like that with all units
Going to return it"
Love this treadmill!! It is quiet and easy to assemble. I have had it a week and it worked perfectly. I love the safety strap feature. Several people had written that their treadmill gave an error message. It does unless you have the safety cord attached properly. It is a magnet. Small and perfect for small space. I am 5'5 and it is great for my size. Stores easily. Really cool color and design. Extremely happy with my purchase. Came in less time then expected
I bought this for my standing desk. This runs louder than I expected it and the speakers are actually unnecessary - when it turns on it sounds like you got a text message alert that's music club decibel level. I found the bottom of the treadmill cosmetically unappealing because it looks like they just gave up during the manufacturing process. Anyway, this does the job, but too much of a hassle to return so I'll just have to keep it and use it. It is functional, just not ideal for the price. This is more of a $200 value to me rather than a $400 value. Just don't buy it. Spend the extra money for quality and the features you want and try to test the product somewhere before you buy it.
Belt keeps slipping to the left. I've only used it a handful of times.
It seems sterdy. The only way it folds is dismantling the arm rests. I used run mode and it sounds like banging on the floor with a hammer- that's why it's suggested to use a matt. Lastly, no volume for the speaker. Summed up, nice machine, great value, doesn't fold, no volume control, and add a matt underneath.
"We downgraded but also upgraded. We had a gym quality NordicTrack but it just took up so much space and was so loud. We sold it and bought this and it's perfect! Best decision. This is perfect for a quick walk or run, much quieter and smaller. Happy with it.
It does skip a little like others mentioned but it's minimal."
Ok, so this treadmill gets the job done! Easy to use right out the box! It's quiet but when I get on it, it sounds like the belt is dragging. Other than that it's awesome, there is an app that come with it and makes it like a little competition. I did have some damage but nothing to seriously complain about, it was perfect otherwise!
Exactly what we were looking for. Love running and this machine is perfect for a run. It is small but pacts enough punch for a long or short run. It is quieter then the other machine we once's owned. The compact size is ideal for our tiny workout room. It's small enough to stick an old Manduka yoga mat under it it. You cannot be disappointed with this treadmill.
This treadmill is super sleek, simple and gets the job done! It's perfect for someone that doesn't have too much space because it's very compact and easy to store. Its very smooth and doesn't make too much noise. I highly recommend it.
Well designed unit. Lots of features w a very modern flair. Not clunky, quiet, efficient. This will impact treadmill design putting down the large useless features provided by large ugly clunky treadmils. I have had multiple units in my life. I amimpressed w this one. Go GOPLUS! I use it daily.
This is great for the money! I live in FL so it's either raining or 100 degrees in the summertime. I have a 5 year old son and a traveling husband, so this was perfect for me to get a workout in without an excuse. I'm 5'10 so it was a little awkward at first, but I'm getting used to it. I watch my shows while I walk/jog/run, but since I'm so tall, it's a little straining on the neck because I have to look downward. That said, I'm well above average height, so I still gave this 5 stars. It's not the best machine, but it's worth the money :)
Product quality is just ok. I don't mind much because it's for my teen but for the price it stinks. Not worth $400. Flimsy setup. Mine came badly scratched up - I'd love to contact the company for a resolution it outside of FAQ can't find a way to contact them. Machine does work but belt is paper thin and had odd seam (see photo) - but seems to be ok. Bluetooth works well. If it weren't for the scratches I'd prob give this a 3. If cost were less a 4.
We have had it for about a month and it works well. My wife uses it in her office to walk on during her meeting. We have not tried to run on it yet. I needed to oil up the bottom of the belt right away. When I walked on it it seemed to stick a little.
"Documentation is very poorly translated.
It's promoted as being quiet but the beeps from turning it on and changing speed are obscenely loud.
Lubricating the belt was a hassle.
Once you attach the arms you'll no longer be able to fold it away unless you take them back off. Installation was difficult so that's not really an option.
Motor makes weird sounds.
All in all its a very cheaply made product. Probably not worth the money. I wouldn't recommend it."
Product comes with issues day1. The belt slips running moderate to high speed. Bluetooth connects to random device and there is no reset option. Seller do not respond quick and email is the only way. Belt got bumps and not smooth and sounds.
The treadmill is easy to assemble and I like that it slides under my couch. I did not attach the 2 arms as it seems like they would prevent me from folding it flat. The belt seems a little choppy sometimes though and adjusting it hasn't worked yet but I will keep trying. My biggest gripe is that the speed is not correct. What it calls 4mph is more like 3mph so I have to have the top part up if I really want to get a brisk walk going. Still, for what it is, it is worth it. I can get in some easy walking while watching TV and it is not too loud.
So far so good! Easy to assemble, very compact and easy to store. Its 75lbs so not too hard to move around. You can access settings from main panel or remote, which is good in case you lose the remote The exterior is plastic so you can't be too hard on it. Nice phone holder and speaker to sync your phone.
I received my product 10 days ahead of the delivery date. I arrived at home and discovered the box waiting and the door step. I was excited about the delivery and carefully took it into the house with my son and unboxed it. I noticed small pieces in the box and didn't expect anything as I immediately connected the treadmill to see if it worked. True enough it did work and everything looked great. I took photos to show the cracked motor cover I found as I lifted up the treadmill to place against the wall. Thanks.
I have had this treadmill since early September and have used it about 10 times, always just walking moderately, and it was always stored properly. I took it out to use it this evening, and it is stuck on an "E07" error message, which is the console lock. The console lock is engaged and locked, but for some reason, it's not reading that it's engaged. This is useless, and I honestly feel like crying. I saved up for this and really need it to keep active during the winter pandemic months. Save your $500.00, folks.
Fantastic space saving treadmill
The instructions on how to assemble the treadmill are written in broken English that make no sense at all. You have to figure out how to assemble it yourself. I used the treadmill once and the next day it stopped working. The track doesn't move at all. The instructions are useless.. It looks like the track is not centered but I'm unclear how to fix it. The worst. Trying to find someone to help is also impossible.
Its louder than I expected. The instructions are vague. It says to oil it will oil provided but it is very difficult to as instructed. However, it still seems loud.
I was sitting in my living room when suddenly I heard a woman's voice in my house. Long freaky story short, somehow my neighbor had connected (her phone perhaps?) to this treadmill's bluetooth speaker. I know of no way to disable this. I was already rather disappointed in the quality and sturdiness of the product--there are issues with the belt already. I wish I had spent just a little more money and bought a better treadmill. I would not recommend buying this product.
Update: Solid product after working with their support in getting me up and walking. Been using it almost daily at work and helps keep me active while remote. Easy to use and quite enough I can be on phone calls without people hearing it running. Would totally recommend to anyone looking for a solid option.
This is not the machine you've used in the gym. It's smaller in all aspects, but strong quality and fits great in the corner of the room. I'm happy with it!
"The only reason that I am giving this product 4 stars is because I am 5'8, and I like to daydream a bit while walking on the treadmill. If I'm not careful, I drift back a bit and hit the back end of the treadmill. It almost knocked me off, but the more I use it, the more I got the hang of it.
It's definitely great for an apartment or small space, and I look forward to logging as many miles as possible on this!"
I love my purchase. It is sturdy, quite, and very compact for use in small apartments. The fact that all I had to do was add the phone holder and arms made it even more awesome.
I am 46 years old and had never worked out a day in my life until I got this. Honestly, I love it. I am 5' 7" and weigh a lot minus 20+ now. :-) I use it to fast walk 3 miles every night. I live in a small apartment and it is the perfect size. There were a few little issues such as the cell phone holder was broken and the machine makes a little squeaking noise but costumer service was quick to make it right. I have already recommended to friends.
I should have bought a standard treadmill. This treadmill makes weird sounds off and on and the belt continues to slip, (I have looked for weeks on how to adjust the tension outside of the 1 boult shown in the user manual. Feel free to comment if you know how to do this because it is now tightened to the max after continued tries). I'm guessing this would be fine for anyone 5'5" and under 150 lbs. Think twice before you spend money on it for sure.
I am not a runner, I never have been. I prefer swimming, but that isn't an option where I live at the moment. I got this as a stop gap until gyms start to be a bit more open- I am not looking for a long term use item. Set up was easy. I can move this around by myself. I love that it can be folded flat and moved out of the way of my kids. It's perfect to keep me moving during this era of COVID gym closures.
I ordered this because I can keep it in my room with the handles down and no one ever knows that there's a treadmill in the room . It's pretty good for walks that you don't get outside .
Works well, is compact, and attractive, although there could be more flexible measuring capabilities. Certainly worth the cost.
The treadmill is compact. It does take some getting used to the stride length room avaiable. However, after only 1 day of using, the treadmill makes a groaning noise and has some loose part to the belt. Not what I expected for paying $500 for it.
This treadmill was exactly what I was looking for. I had a few questions for customer service and they responded so quickly and were super helpful. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a really good treadmill for an affordable price. Highly recommended
Liked the style and the ease of assembly. However, the functions did not work. Seller refunded monies, but now stuck with a unusable treadmill.
The assembly of the handles was a bit clumsy because of how short the bolts and I would prefer if the handle could be straight up instead of leaning forward. But overall, I enjoy using it every morning.
"The plastic they used is flimsy. It arrived with a bunch of broken plastic. Figuring I could live with the broken plastic, I tried powering it on and it wouldn't even turn on.
Overall super disappointed."
Bought this product for my mom and she LOVES it. She now uses it twice a day. This product is very quiet not like a lot other treadmill.
pretty good size to walk at a fast pace, easy to assemble. Only issue will be the noise frome motor but you get use to.
A little narrow for running but achievable. Great for indoor walking and beginner running!
"I am very satisfied with the Treadmill but I have a problem that I would like to solve by myself.
I attached the photo for the seller to explain to me how to repair it. This piece came out of place.
I'm not sure if that happened during use or happened during shipping.
I think it should be very simple to repair if you explain to me how to do it.
I'd like to know if the treadmill has a user manual in PDF"
I needed a small treadmill that I could fold up. I am really enjoying this treadmill. The only complaint is that when you are in walking speed it feels funny, but when you start increasing the speed it normalizes and it's perfect. I love it.
Why won't this machine turn on? Remote does not trigger display. Power button is lit. Saftey magnet in place. Why won't it work?
It was easy to put together and easy to use at your speed and liking. The color I love and look great too. Love it!!!
Overall this is a great treadmill. You can't really compare it to the professional machines at your gym unless you purchase a treadmill with that quality you will not get that from a home treadmill. My only complaint is that the speed is off on it. I was walking at 3.4/3.5 at the gym but on this going 4.2 as a close equvilant.
I am writing this review after using the trade mill for a month, very easy to use and good for people with short height. Not recommend for tall people.I use it everyday so far no issues and it comes with 2 bottles of lubricant.And it is very sleek and easy to put it away.
This is a great little machine! I had my doubts but it's portable, small scale and works great! As some have said, on slower modes it does drag a bit but not noticeable when walking faster or running.
Me encanto, super practica para un espacio pequeÃ±o, pero si es un poco pesada
Nice compact size great for indoor workout
I was very happy with this purchase but the part was broken in two weeks.
Looks nice, folds flat, quiet, my wife really likes it. She keeps it in the living room as it looks nice and uses it while watching TV.
Really enjoying this! It's pretty sturdy, and helps me get steps in at home. It's not a gym grade level treadmill but also didn't pay for that level/ quality and this does the trick for my goal of walking 3-5 miles a day, safely and from the comfort of home.
I like it And I like more how the company answer every single question and very quickly they are really care about costumers , I recommend it
I love the easy transition of lifting/using and folding down of the bar when switching from walking to running
Works very well for my 91 year old mom.
My panel is lifting on one side. It will pop back in place but will come back undone a few minutes after. I haven't even had this a year yet. The Bluetooth speaker is really good. Wish I could find a way to get the panel to stick. It still works just doesn't look very nice lifting like that.
This thing is junk I've been using it now for a couple of months it has worked fine up until a couple weeks ago when it started throwing an error code every time after walking on it for just a few minutes. Don't waste your money like I did, could be a much better product for that price.
It arrived early. Definitely not the Goplus brand. Nothing in the book that came with it said Goplus. Easy to assemble. Not super quiet while walking but not a deal breaker. Definitely heavier and harder to move around than I thought it would be but works fine so far.
It came with dents and the display on the fold-up bar was peeling. Does the job for what you pay, considering we are all limited during this lockdown.
It was not working at the beginning, I was very close to return it, and take I expend a few hours to calibrate it. And it is working OK now.
Great treadmill, my only complain is how narrow it is but I knew how narrow it would be when ordering it. Everyone in my home uses it and loves it.
The packing it comes in does not protect it well. Mine had part of the underside broken off...it still works fine. I just don't love having a partially broken device when I've paid for something new. Not completely understanding how to lube the belt.
"Treadmill is the perfect size for my apt.
Blue tooth works great and the speakers soukds are load and clear.
It is absolutely perfect to me!"
I received the treadmill yesterday and have only walked 2 miles on it. It is already making a squeaking noise, the belt has moved to the left, and the belt slips when you walking. This is frustrating. Maybe I received a lemon.
We were looking for a compact treadmill option and this fit the bill. The tread as very short so may not be great for taller runners, but as a petite woman I enjoy the daily run and fits in our space perfectly.
My husband didn't have any problem assembling the threadmill. Initially we were happy with the low noise level but 2 months later it became loud . So I am not happy with it . Front panel of the treadmill coming off too.
I absolutely love this treadmill! Very happy with this purchase. It's super quiet, great for walking while working for watching a video. My cat doesn't mind it at all, he will nap right next to it while I'm walking. Soooo happy with this treadmill!
This treadmill belt catches all the time no matter how you trouble shoot. This is a poorly built product. This is not a safe. Don't waste your money on this thing.
Easy assembly,
Pretty decent size and perfect for the money you pay.
It was to easy in ten minutes
It works great good for small places
sturdy and spacesaver I like it so beautiful
Good for a starter treadmill. Not for heavy use. Walking and jogging for sure. No real assembly required.
"Not a bad purchase I do love it. Too bad you can't fold it down with the handles attached. Maybe the next Gen will have handles that fold in. But I really am please with this purchase.
I would recommend this item."
Does not work. E07 Error even with stop cord connected. I even had someone take it apart to check what the support person said, still nothing. I have a useless treadmill.
I am very happy with this treadmill. It is small and it was working right out of the box. I would recommend for walking.
This is a very bad product. I have not even use for three moths and is broken. The treadmill motor fails to turn when you step on it. I would like to have this product replaced by the manufacturer.
A great space saver.
Had for less than 2 months and got an error message of E07. Motherboard is fried. Worst treadmill I've ever owned
It's small, perfect. Didn't want a big treadmill taking up a lot of room.
Muy buena, me gustaria tener mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n sobre el tema de mantenimiento
Purchased in October 2020 and have been unable to used, missing key, remote etc. I have requested these items multiple times without a reply. Very frustrated.
Very easy to setup! Good quality! Highly recommended!
Doesn't work. Error code E07.
Love the size I use it every morning and put it away. Work great. It would be great if the phone holder was removable.
I walk the treadmill every morning. It works like a gym treadmill except it could be a little wider.
I like it's size and makes it convenient to get in a great walk without taking up so much space.
I love it! With the cold weather, I hate going out! With Covid restrictions, and limited access to the gym, I have the ability to workout at home!
The top of the treadmill that folds down does not stay secure. It folds down (toward me) when I hold on and walk on it and I cannot figure out how to lock it in place.
I like the fact I can position this anywhere in my house because its so light. Very simple and easy to use
"It has a mechanical twitch - starts speeding up randomly without any prompt.
I plan to return asap"
training
Perfect for a small area/home gym
Cheaply made. Arrived damaged. Hard to assemble when the screws don't fit in the holes
Facil de montar
If u increase speed it vibrates don't buy. Expensive I saw same product for 300
I love the few space than it need
My wife and kids love it
It was easy to assemble and I can store it under my couch
Cool machine gets the job done I love it
It's a little small; but does the job.
Compact, works great. Fast delivery, easy to assemble.
Love it

I really like this product ...
Excelente uso en casa
I like it
I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this treadmill. I hoped it would work well enough that I could use it to shed a few pounds during the Quarantine. I would say if you were under 5'6" and less than 150lbs. this could work for you. Anyone larger than that I would suggest looking elsewhere. I like to hold on to the handles when walking at a fast pace, and the handles on this treadmill seem largely for show as they are not very sturdy. I'm a fairly big guy, at 250lbs. and 6'2". This treadmill just doesn't do well with someone my size. It is advertised as having a weight limit of 265lbs, but It doesn't feel like it would last very long before breaking if someone nearing that weight were to use it for very long. If you are a larger person, take my advice and look for something a little heftier. It will save you having to pack it back up and return it like I'm going to have to.
"Goplus 2 in one Treadmill with Dual Display. Have had this for a month and use it every day for walking. It serves the purpose of a basic compact treadmill for small spaces and is great for walking. It was delivered quickly and arrived undamaged. It actually looks nice in the room, is fairly quiet and runs smoothly. I haven't noticed any lag or skips as some have mentioned. Having the start/stop and speed controls on the upper bar is a big plus in case the remote quits or gets lost. Hopefully it will continue to perform like it has and keep me motivated. I look forward to my inside walks every day.
Tips:
1. Keep the box. If you have to return it you will need it.
2. When first setting up install the arms (if you want) with the bar down. It keeps the screws from falling out. Place the screw in all the way and lift the bar enough to insert the arm and tighten the screw. Repeat and done. If the arm wobbles the screw isn't seated properly. Start over.
3. With the bar up insert the red safety key correctly under the top bar. It won't operate without it and you will get an error message along with beeping if not installed.
4. The remote needs to be pared with the treadmill to work (if you choose to use it). Remove safety key, point remote at lower display, hold the remote power button down, turn power button on and wait for beeps. Done. Power off, replace safety key, power on.
5. Holding the + key down runs up the speed quickly so you don't have to listen to all of those individual beeps one at a time.
6. Check for lubrication under belt. Periodic lubrication is necessary to maintain smoothness and lower the strain on the motor. I bought a kit with an applicator that makes it a much simpler chore (Lube n Walk).
7. Wear comfortable padded shoes or sneakers and enjoy the workout.
8. Need more room “ easily folds up compactly and out of the way (especially without the arms).
Cons:
1. Would be nice if you could turn Bluetooth and beeping off when not needed or wanted.
2. Would be nice to have the lower info appear on the upper display so it would be a true Dual Display. Also, to not have that info disappear as soon as you hit stop.
3. The option to view the speed and distance in MPH would have been a nice feature.
4. The cord should be longer than 4 feet.
All in all, it is a decent, compact, space saving way to get in some moderate low impact exercise when it is just too hot, too cold, too rainy out or maybe you just want to stay home! A little exercise can help to brighten your day. Hope this review was helpful."
I was really looking forward to receiving the treadmill today. After taking the heavy unit out of the box and finally got everything set up, the E07 error code came up and I'm unable to start the machine whatever I try. According to the user manual, the E07 code means the safety lock needs to be reconnected which is exactly what I did, still no LUCK! Try to contact their customer service, there is NOT EVEN A PHONE NUMBER you can call. This is such a waste of time!
I purchased this item despite seeing a few bad reviews. I was hopeful they were just flukes. I was very wrong. After getting the treadmill out of the box I followed the instruction manual to get it plugged in and set up. Instantly after it started there was a high pitched noise that wouldn't stop. The upper display flashed colors yet there was no error showing on the display below. The belt would not maintain speed and there was a host of other issues. I reached out to the company via email and after going back and forth for several days finally gave up and am returning the item, a major hassle as I have to wrestle this 80lb thing back in its original packaging. The company (despite having videos and photos from me as well as very detailed information on the issues) kept insisting they could fix the problem and offer a solution. They sent poor quality videos of some technicians showing the treadmill in pieces and speaking in Chinese to try and help. This is a $400 machine. I should not have to spend literally hours trying to make a brand new treadmill work! Do yourself a favor and don't order this or any other product from Costway (the company that sells the GoPlus Treadmills).
"My treadmill came oiled from the factory. I imagine the stock levels and how long it has been in a warehouse affects that. I may throw some more lubricant at it just to make sure it stays quiet. The setup is very simple. Like others I skipped the side rails since they're short and make it harder to use it as a walking desk treadmill.
I've done a few miles of walking and a couple five K runs and have been very happy with the performance of the treadmill. This is as narrow of a treadmill as you'd actually want to use. I find myself misting here and there. That will go away as my form improves but be sure to take it easy until you get used to running straight on the treadmill."
The quality of the treadmill is good. It is definitely not like the ones at the fitness clubs, but you can jog or run without loosing your balance. If you are not used to running, it might take some time for you to adjust yourself to this tight spaced belt. BTW the reason I give 2 stars is that the seller sent me an old model without touch screen. I will keep this one just because I don't want to spend extra time of mine to replace it. But the seller should not send previous models when there is a distinct difference to the new version in its function.
i got this to walk on at my desk all went well the first day then the belt started sticking/slipping. I put the silicone on it and then it seemed to help for a day. I asked to return the item because i didnt get a treadmill to do maintenance on it 24/7 to make it work. The request was granted but they asked me to do all sorts of stuff with the walking belt and the motor belt which was not for me. hope this helps someone in making a decision as it may not happen to you but know that it could.
The treadmill instructions weren't clear so it took a little longer than it should've to assemble. Once we got it together we tried it out and the belt kept slipping. Bought it at Walmart but figured I'd leave an honest review here. Maybe I just got a bad treadmill but I know from reading the reviews that I'm not the only one.
Relatively lightweight and easy to set up. This is perfect for walking and light jogging. I wouldn't say it's for serious runners but perfect for those wanting to get some exercise. I only wish that it listed mph vs klm. Overall, very happy!
The treadmill was fine for 2 week, then stopped turning on. I received it in June, and still waiting to have someone resolve my problem 2 months later. Im not sure if anyone will take care of it before they say the warranty has expired.
I bought this because I have very limited available space. To my surprise, it's easy to assemble and fold and perfect for in home use. Maybe you can have a try.
Arrived with a broken motor and error code. Never even got to use it. Sellers response was even more rediculous. Buyer beware. The negative reviews are true. I found out the hard way. However I did get my money back. But I rather would have received the product I wanted in working order.
Looks like a thirdparty seller and they just left it out side my apartment complex rather than in front of my door step. The package was sitting in rain for 3 days before a neighbor spotted and alerted us. Then I had to take the damaged package 2 floors myself and at last it resulted in a broken threadmill when i opened which just stops like a jerking motion every one min where u may fall and hurt ur self
I bought this treadmill 3 months ago and already smells like it's going to catch on fire I am really disappointed
"This treadmill melts the soles of tennis shoes. I walk at about 2.9 speed for no more than 45 min and usually less. When I get off the black from my tennis shoe soles gets on my carpet. The Tread shows a mark also. I used two different kinds of tennis shoes.....one with a rubber sole and a better walking shoe for my foot and the other was just a cheap pair.
It's too heavy for me to pack up and mail back."
"As one other reviewer said, this treadmill stalls ever-so-slightly with each step. It seems that the motor is not strong enough to resist the force of each footstep, which creates a slight forward push onto the treadmill belt. We tried tightening the belts, loosening them, more lubrication, every combination possible...did not get better.
Communicating with the company was horrible. We probably had 10 emails back and forth (no phone contact), and it was clear after a while that customer service was not understanding the issue. Also, each time I emailed the company the communication started over again, with no record of previous communications.
Horribly frustrating. I will never purchase something from this company again."
"I just got mine, I plugged it and it's not working.
Has anyone experienced the same issue ?"
"It's small, light weight and pretty. Those the only things I like about it. As I live in a second story apartment in an old building. Also just because it's here I am moving more than I would be with out it.
It continuously pauses my music. When I push play on my phone volume blasts, so seems like a constant playing with music and volume. Better just to skip using the bluetooth feature.
No pause on workout. So you lose all your stats if you gotta jump off for a quick something.
Not really a fan of display at feet. I'm looking down more than I thought I would. Which creates poor running posture and habbits.
Cell phone/magazine holder not wide enough for my phone.
..meant for walking?... 7 is normally running for me. It's a light jog on this treadmill.
Distance time seems pretty good though.
If you use this at home or office and go to a gym and use treadmill don't be surprised if it kicks your ass.
Excellent for the sake of having opportunity for cardio in the convenience of home but I'm not confident I'm getting what I paid for.
Bluetooth feature could be better and if stat display was on the bar that would be infinitely better.
Also if you could monitor your pulse that would be a great upgrade to this machine.
Upon ordering this treadmill I thought it was going to be the greatest thing since lifes bread.. it's just great because I have a treadmill now."
"2-22-2020
This treadmill has totally surprised me! Two years later and it still functions perfectly! The motor still sounds as new as the day I assembled it, the tread still moves smoothly, and all the buttons and programs still work flawlessly.
Definitely a fabulous bang for your buck!!
Original review below:
Treadmill arrived late last night ... late as in time of day, it actually arrived a day ahead of schedule...outer box was in mostly good condition with only one small rip ”- pretty awesome for UPS!
Assembled it tonight ... assembly instructions were clear and concise, with both written and pictorial instructions ... assembly was EASY PEASY!! I did have someone to hold the console section while I connected the wires, that helped a lot.
I was worried because one of the electrical connections had broken in half, but all the wires were intact, still wrapped in their protective coating with no raw wires showing and I was still able to snap the connections together properly.
Plugged it in and got an error message .. turns out that in my eagerness I had forgotten to plug in the safety lanyard! ðŸ˜. I have my toddler and infant grandbabies here a lot so I actually LOVE that it won't work without the safety lanyard attached!!
Once I connected the safety lanyard it started right up and I was a walking fool!!
I will use it for a couple weeks and update with a performance review!
For now, out of five possible stars:
Ease of Unpacking 
Clarity of Instructions: ¸
Ease of Assembly ¸"
"First time buyers “ this review is going to help you make the right decision:
I got the TR150 and it has definitely exceeded my expectation. The thing is my first purchase was a Weslo Cadence G 5.9, obvious choice since it was the best seller in the treadmill category and the price was in the range I was looking for. However, being a first time buyer, my thought was these home fitness equipment should be as sturdy as the ones in the gyms, but I could not be more wrong. So from my experience, hope those looking to purchase a folding treadmill, definitely read on regarding why I feel the TR150 is the right and best choice for a treadmill in this price range.
First off, I'm 6'2 200 lbs and my wife is 5'5 145 lbs and we both regularly use this treadmill for our cardio exercise without any issues. The machine itself is quiet, but of course when you are running on it, it's going to be a bit louder, but I'm still able to watch the TV at normal volume even when I'm running at my top speed of 9mph (it goes to 10). I love the fact that it has an accessory holder rather than just an open space for you to put things because when I'm running fast, I don't have to worry about my water bottle falling down or have fear that it's going to tumble on to the deck and potentially have me stumble over it.
My wife really loves the large display as compared to Weslo's as well as the 3 incline settings (as compared to only 2 for weslo). She's more of a walker/jogger, so she pays more attention to the display than I do since it has graphic that circles around and makes her aware of when she has finished a complete lap. One detail that I really like is that the heart rate monitor is part of the two handle bar on the side rather than a thumb. When I use to run on the Weslo, it was a bit hard to run and know my heart rate as I would feel out of balance, but with the TR150, I can just grab the handle bar while maintaining my foot speed without any problems.
I'm pretty surprised that there are no reviews yet for this product, but given all the functions that it comes with, and how sturdy it is, I definitely feel TR150 will give you more bang for your buck for those looking to give it a try."
"I have had this treadmill for 2 months now and have used is for 45 minutes almost every day. I am a 78 year old woman whose experience with a treadmill has been limited to using the commercial grade treadmill in our community clubhouse.
This treadmill, while not comparable to the $2K commercial grade treadmill, certainly does everything I need it to do.
It is very quiet and does not interfere with the TV if I'm watching it. It is sturdy and well constructed.
There is a ledge for an iPad or Kindle should I wish to read while walking.
And at the end of my walk, I know how long I've walked, how far I've walked and how many calories I've burned. I can also monitor my heart rate as I walk.
I was initially going to pay for someone to come out to assemble it, but after reading reviews, decided my husband and I could do it ourselves. Believe me, there is no need to pay to have it assembled. It was a breeze and took us less than an hour.
All in all, I would definitely recommend this treadmill to anyone looking for one that is no-frill & low price."
"Let me start by saying I don't normally write reviews, but in this case I am making an exception for a couple reasons. First, I must say I was very nervous about buying a product like this online without seeing it in person. But no issue here. After I took it out of the box I was pleasantly surprised. I am not a ""handy"" person at all, but the assembly was a breeze.....and no swearing on my part. I was running on the treadmill in less than 30 minutes after receiving it. Both my wife and I use the treadmill daily and love it!! It is built solid, and the programs provide us with a different workout each time, helping to eliminate boredom. Perfect size because it is so compact.
The second reason for the review is to address comments from other buyers. Someone said it's heavy. Seriously??? It's a TREADMILL!! Would you prefer a model that is poorly built and not sturdy? Someone said it's loud....this is very subjective. But it has a MOTOR! And it's not a $1500 model!! I have been able to watch TV while running on the treadmill with no problem hearing the TV.
Bottom line......great product for the price!!!"
"I'm not sure why there seems to be some negativity about this treadmill. It works very well for the time I've had it thus far. I'm a runner and training for a marathon coming up with the weather being as it is currently I needed a cheap way to get in my miles without getting to the gym as I live rurally. I hunted around a lot before deciding to buy this treadmill and like many have stated this treadmill just simply beats the competition in this price range. When you start looking for auto incline, fancy screens, wide tread and depth, you realize that options become rather... narrow... when looking at sub 800 cost. Well, 800 isn't a bad price for an introductory treadmill but the reviews at that price were still rather wanting more. Things you want to take note of are the warranty, if the motor is warrantied for 30-90 days I'm guessing it's kind of expected to fail, thus I wanted a 1-year warranty on motor, board, and frame. Running boards can crack, motors die, and well most offer some really long warranty on a steel frame it does nothing for me if the motor has stopped working. This treadmill comes with a 1-year warranty, I purchased with an Amex with adds a complimentary 1-year warranty via American Express. So I'm well covered if this should decide to break down.
I also wanted to work on speed intervals, this machine allows this with a max speed of 6min miles (or 10mph), that's an 18:36min 5k for those looking for speed. Unless you're beating that (which maybe you are) then get a machine that can handle 14mph or more.
Pros:
2.25hp Motor with a 1-year warranty
Wide running board
Long-running board
Lack of gadgets to break
Adjustable to the minimum height needed to facilitate outdoor running. (Just adjust it to max incline)
Large capacity 235lbs support (I feel the more it can support the higher impact I can have, thankfully I'm nowhere near this max weight)
10Mph Max speed (6min miles)
Sturdy, weighs 128lbs, steel frame construction
It folds up (I don't bother with this)
Minimal setup and packaging waste.
Cons:
Lack of automatic power off (you've got to hit a switch on the back)
Oil well for lubricant is a bit of a pain to get to
The biggest con, and it's why I took off a star, the incline just sucks... I mean they could have easily added an extra 2-3inches and made it better. I'm even fine without it being ""auto"" but seriously how hard could it have been to add another 2-3inches...
It could use a bottle holder. Seriously? No water bottle holder? I added a bike mount to the bar, problem solved.
A bit more about the usage of this machine.
I run about 6-8 miles a day. I use the machine for about an hour and my wife uses it for 30min. It gets in the winter a solid 1hr 30min a day and sometimes more. It does not seem to overheat, I've run barefoot and shoed, both are about the same. Running board has some nice cushioning (or it seems). I'll update later on how long it lasts."
"WOW, GREAT DEAL -- Delighted we did not buy the $600 to $1,200 treadmills we were looking at. We are fast walkers and will do a light run every now and then. We did a lot of research and the TR 150 actually got 4 stars in the ratings so it beat two and tied one of the treadmills we were looking at. The low price made us a little unsure about what we would get. Thought at the low price compared to the others there must be something wrong. We we totally wrong and are delighted.
We thought it might not be solid but it really is and I weigh in at 225. They held the price down by putting the money into the basics and then limiting the electronic stuff to just 12 programs, pulse rate, time, & distance. Since we have a TV in the room and a tower fan we did not need the expensive displays as this was more than enough and less stuff to break in the future. We would buy it again in a minute. Could not be happier!!!"
"The product works great but it seems to have a big flaw in the design, on the picture you can see whenever you fold it, it's barely secure by piece of metal that if you move the treadmill while folded, it will unfold very easily and could cause severe damage to the person moving it.
Also, the wheel design it's very poor since I couldn't find a way to move it easily using the wheels."
"Pros: Price for quality. At under $300 you really can't go wrong with this treadmill. Nice build and solid design. Motor is very quiet. You hear your steps more than anything. Easy to assemble but it is helpful to have two people; one to hold the upper console while the other connects the wiring harness.
Cons: These are primarily personal things I have noticed and they may not be cons to you. There isn't a way to adjust or mute the sound of the buttons. When you turn it on, there is a loud beep, then a 3 beep countdown, then loud beeps for speed adjustment, etc...Can get annoying and I often walk after my kids are in bed down the hall so that is something to think about. A mute option would be nice. Also, Americans love their cup holders and there are none. It has these two square shaped pockets on the top but they aren't large enough for a water bottle.
The incline is almost non-existent. Don't buy this one if a significant incline is important to you. I just leave it at the steepest setting but it is still barely above flat walking.
It's heavy. I wouldn't think this would be one you fold each time you use it and roll it away. It is difficult to move in the folded position. There are wheels but it's heavy and awkward. It comes packed very well and is heavy. I recommend two people to move the box inside and into place.
Time will tell, but so far, this is a great treadmill for the average walker/jogger. I'm doing about 30 mins a day at 3.0-5.0 mph."
A ++++. It takes about 30 minutes to put together, but all tools/instructions are included and it's simple and straightforward to do. The pieces are just screws and washers -- not complicated. It came well-packaged, so no issues or damage upon arrival --- all you actually have to put together is the arms and the stand, everything else is done. The startup is quick, as the speed buttons are fairly touch sensitive, and the emergency pull works well. My husband is 220, and it said the max weight is 250 -- it hasn't been an issue at all, but it does shake a teensy bit, so we got one of those rubber mats to put under it for support and to decrease vibration --- it's been perfect since then. I recommend a 36 inch foot by 72 inch mat. My sole "complaint" is that there's not a specific water bottle holder -- but the panel up to has space to lean it on the shelf where it lists the speed programs (see pictures), so it's not an issue.
I run 5-9 miles 4 times a week on this. I bought it because it was cheaper, had good reviews. I didnt want to spend $600+ to find out I am really not into it. I've been using it for the last few months. I enjoy it, and do not have negative feedback at this time.
Works great so far. Assembly was easy, took me about 20 minutes. My only complaint is that I wish it was a bit wider, but I guess I'm just used to the gym treadmills. It's not huge, so if you are looking for a space saver-this is it. I bought this one instead of Amazon's pick since the only guy that purchased and reviewed this actually left a good review.
"I bought this treadmill about a year ago, and I've been using it on and off. Presently, during quarantine, I've been using it a lot more and practising to run 10k. That being said, It is serving it's functionality perfectly and it a good product for the price. I would ignore the calorie estimates that the treadmill gives you. The one at 42.195km.net is a lot more useful for giving accurate information. Don't buy it if you want bells and whistles - but do buy it if you want a moving platform to run on for extended periods of time. That being said, there is some important information missing or incorrect in the manual that you will need to know:
The angle of the tread at its three settings, I have measured as follows using a level app on my telephone (the treadmill is never perfectly level):
1 1.11%
1.5 1.67%
2 2.22%
Belt length (for speed calibration):
265.6 cm (measured with a meter stick and gaffer tape)
To reset the 'LUBE' warning after lubricating the tread:
Hold the ENTER key (not the PROGRAM key) for three seconds.
To switch between miles and kilometres:
Hold STOP and the UP ARROW key for a few seconds."
The box package came was ripped and not secure. Setup was easy but after walking 1 hour on treadmill an error code 4 displayed and whole treadmill stopped working. 1 Star is for initial impression of product. Now I have to go through time and trouble to return or get fixed/replaced. This shouldn't happen right out of box. Hopefully, I can come back and give better review for how this problem is handled.
I also received a non working treadmill. E2 message saying belt was not aligned properly. I am returning unit which is not easy to put back in box and tape up the box! Very much disappointed!
"Got this yesterday, put it together today, looks fabulous, turned it on E4 error doesn't work at all..... called the number in the instruction book, they were very helpful sending out parts and a technician to fix it hopefully in the next week or two, we shall see, I'm all for sending it back but my hubby says let's see if they get it working, however I'm very sceptical about getting something that's brand new fixed and wonder what the long term problems will be. I'll write an update once they've fit the part.
Update.... problem solved a week ago :))
Customer service was absolutely brilliant, sent a technician within two days who fixed the lose wire. Iv been using it ever since. And I give you my word, out of all the treadmills Iv had over the years, and believe me Iv had some very expensive ones whilst globe trotting, and I was even ripped off with the slim tread one who sent a broken one and wouldn't give me a refund, so stay away from slimtread and buy this instead. I can't believe how brilliant it is for such a low price, it's compact but not small if that makes sense, it's very very sturdy and the noise level is the best of any Iv ever had. The only con is the so called cup holder, no, you can't fit any kind of drink in those lolll but it's not a problem at all. I feel very confident about keeping this machine because of how brilliant customer service was, I know if anything happens they'll fix it. I love love love this treadmill. Don't be put off by the low cost, go ahead and buy it, it's brilliant. And if you have a problem like I did just call their customer service and they'll sort it out ASAP, such a great company."
Had good reviews. Highly disappointed. Only weigh 190 and I can't run on this thing. The entire belt portion basically skips a beat whenever I step on it or even try to run at any speed and I almost fall off. I've had multiple people try this of various weights and they experienced the same thing. You have to catch yourself from falling off. Can't even run on a treadmill which is its only purpose. Not sure if this is just mine or if it the product in general. Will be returning. And yes I put it together properly
"This treadmill is pretty good, but not great. After running on it for a couple of days I think I can give you a great idea of what it's like.
NOTE: The front plastic cover that's above the motor may rub against the track causing nose at some speeds. Loosen the screws on either side of this plastic cover (don't remove entirely). As you tighten the screws back in, lift the cover so that it remains higher up. This will help the noise issue.
For context for the pros below, here's my metrics:
Height: 5'10""
Weight: 185 lbs
Shoe Size: 11E
Fitness Level: Beginner
Normal walk/run: 1.5 mls, 200 cal burn, 30 min
PROS:
* It's fairly small, but not too small. I'm in a single bedroom apartment and was able to find a place for it. It has a wide and long enough track to run on, but not too large that I wouldn't have been able to find a place for it or get it through a doorway.
* It has fractional speeds from 0 - 10. Maybe 5 isn't quite good enough for your jog, but 5.5 is. I jog at about 5.0, but I run when its on 6.5. I'm not sure how I could ever run fast enough for the top speed of this thing.
* It's easy to put together even for 1 person; keep in mind this thing is very heavy so it took me a while to get it in the right position.
* The motor is very quiet; but there are other noises -- read the cons.
CONS:
* It's still pretty large when it's folded up. If you have a normal sized closet it's probably going to be the only thing in that closet. If you have a walk-in closet, it's going to take half the space up.
* The machine makes a lot of noise. The best I can figure out is that the plastic in front of the unit is sometimes touching the moving tread. It's a low frequency plastic on rubber sound, it's not super loud, but somewhat annoying. If it weren't for that, this thing would be extremely quiet!
* It's prone to damage in shipping because the cardboard box isn't great quality for an item this heavy. Expect the box to arrive partially destroyed and the plastic strips around the box to have dug all the way down to the treadmill due to shipping guys trying to carry it there. I think for most of us, the product inside is usually ok. Mine has a very small minor dent.
* If you accidentally detach the safety cord (the one you clip onto your clothes), the machine will go into an error mode (normal) that cancels your workout program and you'll lose all progress. I ran for about 10 minutes and accidentally disconnected it, lost all data for that run and had to start over and remember how much I had already done. Not a big deal.
* The heart monitor works, but it may start off at a lower bpm than it should - I've had issues with heart monitors you hold onto become inaccurate simply because you're moving while you're touching them. Get an Apple watch instead.
Am I happy? Yes! For the price I was expecting these sort of cons, but given the problems this treadmill accomplishes what I need. I'll report back if I can fix the noise."
"I am extremely disappointed in this treadmill. It gets 1/5 stars because, admittedly, the belt does move and allow for walking. That's it.
First of all, the measurements on this listing are NOT accurate and don't include several pieces that are on the sides of the treadmill. I purchased this treadmill specifically because it would fit in my biggest closet, which it doesn't. Because the dimensions are wrong.
Second, the incline is nonsense and almost a lie. At its HIGHEST setting, the BACK of the treadmill is an inch off the ground. The BACK of it. Which means you're walking at a... decline? Unless you leave the treadmill in it's normal position, which is flat. So, DO NOT BUY if you want an incline, which I did.
Third, the buttons on the side arms are fake ” just pieces of plastic that do not function. Why??
Fourth, there are no cup holders or anywhere you can put a cup or water bottle. There are weird, small, square holes (about 2x3 inches), which would only hold a Dixie cup or remote control.
And fifth, the treadmill wobbles and shakes when I just power walk at 3.5, and I'm a 5'3 female weighing 128 lbs.
I so regret buying this treadmill. I have no idea how to send it back, as the packaging arrived broken, and the treadmill is way too heavy for a small female to maneuver. I wish I had never bought it and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE."
"Unfortunately I received a non-working treadmill. Called Amazon and they were helpful but only compensated $30 for all the struggle I had with shipping as well. I called XTERRA and did some troubleshooting with them. The machine has an EO error which is a safety key. The company had me use a nail filer to file the metal part of the safety key to work (to create contact they said) but it didn't. They suggested a replacement.
I struggled so much to get this machine home and this morning I left it outside my door for a UPS to take it back. I was so upset as I had a lot of hope for it. I selected this treadmill because of that one great comment the one person made on this machine. It does looks nice and it is a space saver. I'm familiar with Xterra's triathlon so I figure this had to be a good piece of equipment. I'm going to purchase Amazon's best seller and see how that goes."
My husband bought me this treadmill as a Christmas gift to replace my old one (18 years). After about 7 weeks of use it began turning itself off when I was walking, now at around 8 weeks, it finally died. Called the company and they are sending out a new controller, which I either need to install myself or pay someone to do. It is supposed to be here in three days, will update when it arrives! I will most likely be able to install it but I've lost my faith in this product. If this controller died in 8 weeks what does that say about the reliability of this product and the future of the new controller! Before I buy another, I will make sure the company guarantees and repairs the product. Lesson learned.
"I am very big on reading reviews especially if I buy big ticket items. So I hope I can give you a piece of mind by Choosing this treadmill. It arrived at 1:45 today Aug 5, 2020 and my hubby had left for work so I was all alone putting it together. It took 15 mins to unbox the treadmill and separate the parts. I thought it was going to be complicated like my 2500.00 machine. But it only had 12 screws, 12 washers, 1 key, 1 Allen wrench, small bottle of lubricator. So it didnt look to scary for a 55 year old to put together. By 2:15 step 2 was completed and the bars that held up the console was completed with six screws and washers. The trickiest part was making sure the electrical wire going through one side of the console poles was connected on both the top and bottom before screwing in the 3 screws. Then I put the console on top and connected it with the last 6 screws. Guess what its done!! OMG its only 2:30 and I put the safety key in (RED) then connected the plug and hit the on switch in the front and I AM OFF AND RUNNING. My last 2500.00 Treadmill was so complicated I needed to pay a tech to put it together.
ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ðŸ¥³ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ I am so happy I choose this treadmill brand. By the way it looks Awesome the Royal blue side strips are rich in color and the overall treadmill is sturdy and has the look of a 2000.00 treadmill. I can't wait for my hubby to see how great it looks. Oh I have to give my son credit for helping me bring it in the house and upstairs.
It has 2 slanted shelves on each side to hold a water bottle and cell phone. There are two square 3inch deep sections for holding my ear buds and glasses. It has a shelf to hold my 11 inch apple IPad. ðŸ¤“ðŸ‘ For the price I am head over hills for my new treadmill. The foot space is great for my 10.5 size feet. It came on with no issue right after i put it together in 30 mins. I walked and ran on it without tripping over my feet. I love the pulse reader on the console handles that is Awesome. Time for me to take a run on my new Treadmill. BYE ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’ƒðŸ½"
I purchased this so I can maintain my running routine during coronavirus-related quarantine/ stay at home order. So far, I've run about 35 miles on this and feel ready to write a review. I was apprehensive about buying this model, since many of the reviews seemed to be from walkers, not runners, but ultimately decided to go with this one, over a more expensive model, primarily because I was looking for something cheap and because of the weight and ability to assemble it and move it around my small apartment by myself. I can say it was absolutely the right decision! This was extremely easy to assemble with one person (took me about 20 minutes), and works surprisingly well, at various paces. I've tested it with an 11 mile run at 7 mph (8:33 min/mile) and used it for intervals at 9mph (6:45 min mile) and it held up well at both paces. It is surprisingly quiet for a lighter machine and feels stable while I'm running on it (I weigh about 125lbs, so if you are on the heavier side it might be a different experience). The one downside is that the mileage tracking seems slightly off, but the pace feels spot on, so I approximate distance based on pace and total time. If you are looking for something basic to run on, I would highly recommend it! Also, you can fit a laptop in the slot on the top, so you are able to watch virtual trail running videos etc on youtube without spending the money on a more expensive machine with video capabilities. I really hope it stands the test of time as I run more miles on it, and will update my review if needed, but for now, I highly recommend.
Will try to make this long review as short as possible. After thee months and ten days the Lube notice malfunctioned and could not be removed by me. I called the company twice and each time what they told me to do did not work. I said I would try one more time and this time I was lucky enough to reach a service tech by the name of Devonnia. Believe it or not, she stayed on the phone with me for a good hour trying to resolve the problem. Finally, she advised me that although I was ten days pass the warranty period, she would issue a new console, which was on back order and would not be available for about two months. Because I absolutely loved everything about this treadmill, and realizing that things happen, I accepted the offer. I am 82 years old and walking on a treadmill definitely keeps me moving. Low and behold I received an email from her boss this morning advising the were sending me an upgraded model at no additional cost. His name is Daniel Miller. I am a frequent buyer on Amazon. I have never encountered any company or employees as nice, competent, and courteous as these two. Like I said, things happen, but this treadmill is excellent for anyone looking for a treadmill for walking at a great price. I wholehardily recommend the Xterra company.
Great treadmill without question. However, the silicon lubricant should come with it. The treadmill needs to be lubed every 40 hrs and the silicon gel needed is not available locally. Thank god for amazon prime.
There were initial problems (which post-reading reviews I expected). The first being a ding (I could care less about) on the walkway. The ding doesn't do anything, it just looks like a minor dent. The 2nd issue was the side knob that holds up the walkway wouldn't budge an inch. I called repairs and got a numbskull who stubbornly insisted I'd have to return the entire treadmill to fix the minor knob problem. Eventually I lost my temper, demanded to speak to the manager. The manger was a complete angel. She was patient and super helpful, ordering a new knob that was shipped to me. Then, without my having to do a thing, a repairman called me, set up an appointment, then came and totally fixed not only the knob, but the noise level of the treadmill's belt. The thing is now danged near silent. The remaining problem is, even when the now functioning knob is in place, the vertical treadmill track can slip and slam to the floor at any given time. I'm just going to be very careful (and plan to see if the belt that held the treadmill together during shipping, might be long enough to use in restraint of the treadmill track when it's in the upright position. So the caveat is BE AWARE THE KNOB IS NO GUARANTEE THE HEAVY WALKWAY WILL NOT FALL DOWN! But for that one safety issue, the treadmill would have five stars.
"So I've had this treadmill for a couple months now. It was under $300 so I wasn't expecting the highest quality machine, I just needed something to help get me moving more. I run and walk on it a few times a week and overall I'm very happy with it. I have been working on my mile time so I only really run for maybe 2 miles and then I do walking intervals. It is the perfect size for me, I'm 5'3"" and weigh about 145 and have been somewhat of a runner in the past and I try to stay in shape. I have short legs but I feel the width of the belt is adequate for people of any height, I know that some cheaper treadmills have skinny belts and it's very uncomfortable but this one is actually pretty great. The length of the running platform may be troublesome for really tall people or those with long legs but for me it's perfect. I've never come close to falling off and I don't feel like I'm too close to the edge. The setup for the display is nice, clear, and user-friendly and I like the position and size of the handles. It is very easy to fold up and move around and is more compact than I expected it to be when folded up. I really like the different program choices as well and it has more features than I'd expect for a treadmill at this price point.
Originally I was going to give 4 stars because there is no incline, but after thinking about all the great things about it I'm changing my review to 5 stars. It's my own fault for not reading the description thoroughly enough. The setup was simple enough, I had a friend help put it together and in about 10 minutes it was ready to go and has been working well ever since."
After the assembly of this treadmill (and it is heavy), plugged it in, turned it on, and there was a sound of "pop" with a flash of light at the front of the treadmill and the treadmill would not work. An error message of E8 was on the panel and could not be fixed as E8 is not listed in the "trouble shooting". Contacted the company and was told that "it was under warranty" "they would order parts" and "a technician would come and fix it" and I had not even used the treadmill. If there was a rating lower than one star this is what the product deserves. The "supervisor" will be contacted during "office hours" to discuss options of this machine.
"Update: Four months in the treadmill stopped dead from a speed of 3 in an E2 Error, scaring me and jerking my back hard as I jolted to keep from walking into the control panel. Although I had cleaned and lubed the unti earlier in the week, I did so again. The error returned three more times over the next week. Quite honetly I developed a fear of using it. Everytime I walked, I passed the time waiting for another error. I called the manufacturer and was told the error is caused by the wrong lube. The bottle I was using camed from Dick's Sporting Goods. I had just started purchased an almost $30 double pack of lube from Amazon so I abandoned the remaining lube and switched. With some concerns remnaining, I tried to push through and get back to my routine. I went to doing short walks (<30mins) and walking less than 2 miles a day. I slowly worked my way back up and about six days in - another error. I called and spoked to the manufacturer again, telling them of having switched lubes and the error returning. They assured me the only reason for the error was the wrong lube. I went and purchased more lube locally. I clean the unit and put on the new lube. The errors and issues greatly impacted my interest in using the treadmill. Over the next month or so I used it sparingly, never more than 30 minutes or over a speed of 2. I finally got through two lube cycles without any errors. Today I tried to start increasing my speed to 2.5 and the error returned. I'm beside myself and this what I'm afraid is to become an expensive paperweight sits beside me. As my impression of this treadmill has decreased so has my rating. Please be careful and considerate in purchasing this unit if you plans include using it.
Original Review: Professional fat guy. Have had the unit for just over 5 weeks and have gone from an hour a day to between three and four hours a day on it. Happy so far with the mechanics of the unit. It seems to be well constructed and of suitable materials. Not pleased that the LCD screen is located where the manufacturer provides a tablet shelf as a tablet blocks the screen. Feel it would be better to have more digits on the displayed info as the words could be simple abbreviations, especially for distance as miles and tenths is a little limiting (and having hundreds and maybe thousands would be motivating). Not pleased that I was thirty-something minutes into an hour walk when the ""LUBE"" notice came up in place of the time and there seems to be no way to again see the time. The time, on my unit at least, does not track to either of two cell phones (always different either long out short) and the distance isn't tracking correctly either. At 3.0 mph I should be completing a tenth of a mile every two minutes but the distance figure is changing at intervals other than two minutes, again sometimes short and others long. I am getting some weight off, which is the ultimate goal, but kind of perplexed by the wonky electronics."
"In short: Treadmill works really well when working properly. Support is terrible.
For the amount of money we paid for this treadmill we were hoping for very few hiccups and that it would just work. Wasn't quite the case.
Assembly was pretty straightforward. Parts are a little heavy so you may need assistance putting it together but I was able to do it by myself.
*Important* This treadmill requires a grounded plug. I've seen reviews with this problem, if you don't have the proper outlet this treadmill WILL NOT WORK. First of all, this treadmill has a three prong power cable. So your outlet will need to have either the three holes, or an adapter. But that's not all.
THE OUTLET CANNOT HAVE THE LITTLE BLACK AND RED BUTTONS. Some outlets have these little red and black buttons by the outlets. I believe the red button usually is labeled as ""reset"". If your outlet has these buttons... DO NOT BUY THIS TREADMIILL. Or any treadmill really. Because of the heavy motor, it will trip the outlet every single time! This needs an outlet without those little buttons in order to work. Luckily for me I had a outlet like this several feet away and an extension cord did the trick.
Now comes the bad part where I had a support issue.
I assembled the treadmill and turned it on. Belt ran just fine. When I got on it, every step I took the belt stopped. I tried standing it and then turning it on, started at .5 mph moved it up to 3mph. Same thing, every time I took a step or stood up normally the belt would just get stuck under me.
I weigh 185lbs and even my girlfriend who weighs considerably less tried it with same results. Weight capacity is actually 250lbs on this machine.
I called the support line and I get connected to what sounded like a little office in Arkansas.
The rep told me to tighten the belt. With no results.
He then told me to lubricate under the belt a little. With no results.
He then told me to empty the bottle of lubricant under the belt and let it run for 5 minutes. With no results.
I called back and got a different support rep. He had me do the same troubleshooting steps. He then sounded confused and said that it may be the electronic board. He ordered a board to come to my house and set up a visit from a local fitness equipment company.
The day came where the part arrived and the technician came to the house. He was astonished that the entire bottle of lubricant was used under the belt. He cleaned it as best he could and tightened/untightened the belt. Still was getting the same result of the belt sticking whenever weight was applied.
He then called the treadmill company and was put through the ringer. They didn't really believe what he was telling them. They tried to make excuses such as him weighing too much, or that the extension cord was the problem. He said that he wanted to replace the belt because of the poor direction that was given of lubricating it so much that it was soaked with lubricant. They did not want to replace the belt because it was so expensive... The technician was so frustrated and surprised at what the support team was telling him. Finally, the technician opened up the casing of the motor and noticed that a little driving belt was loose. He moved the motor a bit, tightening the driving belt. And the treadmill finally worked as it should.
We walked on the treadmill and it ran fine. He said to keep it under 4 mph to prevent risk of slippage and not avoid lubricating the belt for 6 months. All this because the support team from the manufacturer gave dangerous advice. A quick Google search shows that the driving belt is a common cause of treadmill belts slipping. They should have known this.
I have been using the treadmill since and it works great. Whether walking or running, it runs as it should. I will say that it is a bit loud. I have to crank up the TV really loud to hear it. Or I just use headphones. And the calorie count is way too overestimated. But other than that I do enjoy this treadmill now. It's plenty wide and long for me.
I still would recommend this treadmill. It's build solid and has everything you need. But I suggest you first make sure you have the right outlet for where you plan to put it. And if you run into a problem to contact a local fitness equipment company. Xterra or whatever the company is called is a joke when it comes to support. A quick Google search shows that they are a bit subpar when it comes to quality service. Online they're listed as this address.

Again, treadmill itself is good. It's support team should be ashamed of itself for giving out instructions that could harm their own product."
This is a basic treadmill, which I was fine with. I literally just need something to move on indoors. So I could overlook that distance counter was a little off, the timer is a little off, the calorie counter is way off, heart rate monitor doesn't work, nor do any programs. Fine. I can monitor all of these things with my smart watch. However, 90 days in and the display is scrambled, like in the picture I shared. It happened all at once while I was walking on it. The treadmill is still currently working, but I'm not hopeful as to how long. If you can stretch your budget a little further, I'd probably look for something else. Otherwise, it was easy to assemble and easy enough to move around.
"Not much to say here. I was excited to receive this, but then disappointed when, after following the instructions carefully and assembling everything (not much to assemble), we plugged it in and were going to try it out only to get an E5 error repeatedly. Tried a few different things to try to get the error message to go away but it never did. Treadmill did not run even a single time.
The return process also a bit of a headache with UPS and Amazon giving me different information."
Less than 3 months of using this new treadmill I'm receiving error code E5. Treadmill stops after few seconds. If you need good treadmill you need to spend more money!
"So I want to start by saying this treadmill really helped me get thru quarantine. I was putting on weight and becoming apathetic. This treadmill was an affordable and essential part of my quarantine boost. Was relatively easy to put together and is very small and folds up nicely.
The negative-This treadmill is pretty noisy right from the start, however over time it's become borderline unusable due to its volume. Anytime I put this over 7.5 speed, it starts squeaking and whining at a volume that is distracting and noticable to neighbors. I've done the lubrication and maintenance, but nothing has helped.
Not a bad purchase for a few months, but doesn't seem to have staying power."
So far it seems to be working just great. Couple of dings n cracks (most likely from shipping) but does not affect the performance. What I want people to be aware of most is that the little rod feature that is supposed to hold the track in the folded up position does not work that great. The slightest little bump or push / pull will make it come loose and when that falls it can cause some serious damage. I had a couple of close calls with it already and now I just leave it unfolded all the time. Other than that so far so good. I had a couple of good runs on it already and am very much satisfied.
"Hard to believe I've had this for almost two years now. For reference I'm 5'6 and it fits my stride just fine. I try to remember to lube the belt every month- sometimes I forget- but it has handled my somewhat apathetic maintenance well.
The two biggest issues I've had that made me take off one star is folding it up and the clock. The metal knob (not sure what to call it) that you pull out and push in to hold the treadmill in place when you lift it up, that rusted pretty bad early on which made it difficult to pull in and out. My solution for that is to take a hammer to it and tap it to loosen it when I can't pull it out on my own. The other issue, and I included a picture for this one, is the clock. On average the clock is behind about 20 seconds for every 15 minutes. So if you work out for 45 minutes the clock will say 44. I'm just using this for my general health, so that's not a huge deal, but it's worth noting if you're neurotic like me or serious about your time. Overall, I'm pretty happy with my purchase. I've been using this almost daily since I've got it, for anywhere from 3 to 5 miles a day, and it's held up well."
I had this treadmill for less than a year. I used it 5 days/week for walking. I did all the required maintenance. The treadmill stopped working -both the motor and dashboard are messed up. I contacted Xterra who said since I was past the 3 month warranty period there was nothing they could do about it. Fortunately Amazon is working with me for a partial resolution but I will never purchase another Xterra product. Waste of money!!
If you know you need to walk/jog but you are either scared of or grossed out by your local gym, stop wasting money on that membership and just get this. It will do the job. It's easy to assemble and you can finally workout without worrying about germs or judgement. Just do it. Get one. You need it.
I purchased this simple treadmill because my doctor said i should walk for my health and there is nowhere to walk outdoors where i live, unless you walk on the roadway, which is dangerous - no sidewalks or nearby parks. i have health problems and walking is directed as my best course of exercise. i never ran this treadmill any higher than level 1 ! --and have only used it one or two days a week as my overall health allowed. the entire control board has seized up and "fried", for lack of a better word and though the tech was extremely courteous, you are sent replacement parts and you have to try to fix it yourself! i am a senior citizen and am not strong enough to take this entire machine apart and it took my daughter (trying to help me) - hours of her time and strength to remove dozens of screws , only to find that the connectors will not come out of the circuit board to replace the damaged part - this is crazy and unacceptable!! ----DO NOT BUY this treadmill from this manufacturer! - unless you are a mechanic or have a degree in treadmill repair!!!!
"This is a very good starter machine. It is extremely quiet and smooth. I like the programs. Having something that changes every few minutes helps to alleviate some of the monotony. Assembly was very easy and it was delivered quickly.
As to the claims: the pulse monitor is a bit like a stopped clock. It is right sometimes, but you are never sure when. When I looked into buying a separate monitor, it turns out they cost almost as much as the machine. So I guess I will learn to count my own if I decide I really need it. The bit about it being cushioned seems a stretch. I prefer to exercise in socks, and it was comfortable enough for that, so I am happy on that score even though I don't find the description accurate. As others have pointed out, the incline is tiny. It is a would-be-nice thing, but not a deal breaker.
Overall, it meets my needs perfectly at this time."
I'm giving this 4 stars for 'workout' only because I am 80 yrs. old and just walk on it. I have owned several treadmills (2 of them from a cheesy but famously named company that cost double what this one costs.) I used reviews to settle on this one, so I feel obliged to contribute. If your easy mobility days are behind you but you still want to keep moving, you should give this one a try. The bells and whistles are minimal. It keeps track of time spent, calories burned, and speed used. Controls are easy. If you want to use 21st century sound equipment (e.g., Blue Tooth etc.) you'll have to bring your own. I have a huge jazz and classical cd collection I want to use, so I have to jury-rig a player and extension but it works fine. The belt is narrower than my past treadmills, but not so narrow that an elderly gentleman can't hang on. If you want more than 3 elevation levels, too bad. I just leave the elevation stuck on the default number. For the money I don't think this treadmill can be beat if you are older and just want to keep moving. Skip the high priced fancy named stuff. This is a winner.
"For the price, I am convinced that you won't find a better treadmill. Not super heavy. Easy to install. Folding is easy enough, though it may be a wee bit heavy for some. I'm late 40s. Strong. Athletic. But I had two lower discs replaced a year ago. Walking has been my salvation. Wanted something for the bad weather months. It's perfect.
Having read several reviews prior to purchasing, true, it doesn't have a cup/bottle holder. However, I am able to place a bottle of water, my iPhone XS, and a TV remote in the areas on either side of the digital readout (see pics). Also, oiling the track is a bit cumbersome, but truly doable.
I use it almost daily. I am 5' 9 and around 185-190, and it's comfortable.
Only negative is that the belt isn't as wide as those at the gym. However, it has well placed side rails and an area either side of the belt that keeps one's feet from catching if one doesn't hit the track spot on.
Again, well worth the money!!"
The treadmill came in 2 days. Packaging A+ . No damage to it whatsoever. I am 5'6 and the handles sit comfortably at my hips. Shoe size 8.5 (tried to show how wide the band is). My band is nicely centered but it is definitely adjustable if it should move left or right. I like all of the speeds but I am not that fast of a runner. I joggish at 6.3 setting and run MY fastest at setting 7. It goes up to 9 which I'll probably never use haha.
"Great small unit. Good simple interface with basic programming. Yes it is slightly on the narrow and shorter sides, and the incline is manual. That's all part of the great value. Good cushion running.
Install very easy. Only one bolt size with one Allen wrench provided. Two washers which you can see when to use without needing manual. Ten to fifteen minute setup.
I dropped the star for one less than perfect implementation. I wanted to switch display from miles to kilometers. Nothing was mentioned in manual, FAQ, or anywhere online. Tech support was available via telephone which was impressive. While there is a hidden engineering mode, there isn't an actual kilometer translation. Your only option would be to recalibrate the speed to match kilometer speed. So it is a fixed setting overriden through a calibration.
This would explain why so many reviews say the speed is off. It takes a speed meter to calibrate. My complaint is only partially not having Kilometer option, although that is a normal expectation that doesn't actually add any cost. The complaint is not explaining that in specifications, manual, or online faq. Just say that is a limitation and it would reduce frustration. Or better yet, add that to the interface which doesn't cost anything new.
Other than that, I am very pleased with the unit performance and value. Arrived in 72 hours."
The latch that holds the running area folded is too small to handle the weight. After folding this and attempting to roll it a few inches, the latch came unhooked the running area fell into my face, breaking the bridge of my nose. The design is flawed. I'm just so lucky it didn't fall onto one of the children or dogs in the household, has enough weight to have killed them.
"Have had this for 4 months. Got an E4 message for the motor after it making awful noises and slowing and speeding up for no apparent reason. Finally died. Called the company and was 30 days out of fixing it warranty, but still in new motor warranty. Said they would send a new one but I need to pay for someone to install it. Then the best part is that the motor is in backorder and they couldn't give me an ETA for shipment. Probably will cost more to have someone come out that what I paid for the equipment. Very disappointed.
Updated 8/20/19
Spoke with the company and Daniel was very helpful and understanding of my disappointment. My new motor was sent out, arrived and I installed. I was informed they would have made arrangements, but everything worked out. I was very happy with the customer service and appreciate their time. Equipment is working good now."
"This treadmill is very suitable for my needs/wishes. Compared to my old Proform 590T treadmill it is lighter, a bit smaller, and lower to the ground (the walking mat). I'm like a sheep jumping a fence that is no longer there. I step higher to get on it and am surprised when my foot goes lower than expected (my own problem...). What I like: It was VERY easy to set up even without help. I like the size better (smaller), lighter than my old one, and it is quiet. I can hear what's going on around me now. Works well, for the time I have had it (less than a week). I don't know anything about running on it other than YouTube videos. I walk on my treadmill for an hour every day unless traveling, etc. I was able to easily fabricate a wood platform to hold my laptop while I'm walking (like right now)! This is a great walking treadmill.
Things I'm not crazy about: I don't like the position of the on/off switch near the floor around in front, but I think a lot of brands are like this. The key on the top is difficult to put in and out, but time/use will probably help that. I haven't seen a good guide as to what the automatic program functions do. I haven't looked too hard though since I just walk. It has an annoyingly slow start - 3, 2, 1, then slow to get up to speed.
All in all, I like the treadmill and would recommend it to a friend. It does what I need it to do and much cheaper than my old Proform 590T which I definitely under utilized. My Proform has lasted 10 years and still works well except it is very noisy now. It could probably be fixed, but not by me... I would have to haul it 60 miles each way just to get an estimate. I'm 72 and it is too heavy to be loaded and unloaded easily, no matter how strong I imagine myself to be... We'll see if I can get 10 years out of this one! If this review shows up as a Sue review, It's really me, Scott."
"Received this product a couple months ago, and it took a couple of months to get it set up, I'm a bit lazy, hence why I bought the treadmill in the first place to try and quit the habit.
Anyways, I set the whole thing up. Assembly wasn't horrible, just tedious. However, once I got it set up it kept giving me the E5 error code, which said something about it not communicating between the console and the motor or something along those lines. I figured that because it has a cord that runs from the base up the right arm of the treadmill I figured it must be something that I plugged in wrong. So I disassembled it all again, fiddled with the cord in there and put it back together and still got the E5 error.
We called customer service and they adamantly refused to give any help, saying that we needed to do exactly what I had already attempted to do by disassembling the right arm and trying to plug the cord in different ways. That didn't help at all, and they refused to give us any other help.
I'm thinking of returning it at this point. But I would beware. If you are looking for a cheap treadmill, this one doesn't seem to have the customer support necessary to help you if you get a defective model and I might try another company before going with this one."
A NICE SIDE COMPACT THREADMILL. WHEN I PUT IT TOGETHER, I PLUGGED IN AND TURN IT ON. THE THREADMILL BELT STARTED TURNING AT FULL SPEED, WITH AN ERROR CODE E4.I PRESS THE STOP BUTTON, BUT IT DID'NT STOP I HAD TO UNPLUGED IT. I READ THE TOUBLESHOOT SECTION IN THE MANUAL. IT SAID LOOSE WIRE OR MOTOR WIRED WRONG. HAD TO REMOVE COVER AND SHAKE THE WIRES.. THEN IT WORKED FOR TWO WEEKS UNTIL THE SAME PROBLAM STARTED AGAIN. I SPOKE TO A TECH. TECH SAID IT COULD BE THE MOTHERBROAD, THEY DID,NT HAVE ANY ON HAND, IWOULD HAVE TO WAIT. CALLED AMAZON AND SEND IT BACK.
It is a little heavy for me of course. I need help putting it together, but I am 65 years young. I looked at various treadmill for several months because I didn't want to have to buy one and have to return, which is what happened the first time. I weigh 280 lbs. I needed something sturdy and with a wide belt space. I have used commercial treadmills all my life in gyms, and never thought I would find one for my apartment that was compatible to a commercial treadmill. Yes I did. I am a walker, and not a running. But this machine is absolutely wonderful. When I turn it on, I didn't hear anything, but the belt was moving. That is how quite it is. Very sturdy, and the wide walking space is very comfortable for my size. The price was under $400. Great great buy!!!!
"UPDATE
Getting a hold of customer service again has been almost impossible. We've tried 6 times in two weeks- on hold for 15 minutes or more each time- with no luck. I also forgot that the digital display on the treadmill gets funky- it starts to distort/black out so you can't read the display (I saw someone else was having this issue as well). So disappointed. Would NOT recommend this treadmill.
I purchased this treadmill on December 16, 2019. On November 16, 2020, it stopped working (could not adjust the speed; the belt would not move). The company told me they think they know what the issue is- the part is $120- but if they are wrong I can return the part and will be charged a 20% stocking fee.
I'm disappointed that the treadmill broke after less than a year (I'm not a hardcore user- I'm on it 20 minutes a day three times a week). While I did not purchase an extended warranty I was also disappointed with the customer service regarding the issue. Now I have to decide if I want to sink more money in to this treadmill or call it a loss."
"So, I ordered one of these at the beginning of the pandemic because I was no longer willing to go into my gym. I would say that I run about 50% outside and 50% inside, never more than 3-4 miles, so not by any means a performance runner. When I received this the FIRST time, the packaging was absolutely destroyed; however the product itself didn't seem to have any dents or abrasions so I set it up. Within 2 days I noticed that the LED display was becoming totally garbled, to the point where I couldn't really read the speed or the time. Amazon swiftly replaced this, picking up the old one and delivering a new one, which was great.
However, recently the newer one has started exhibiting the same problem with the display. It's somewhat frustrating, because I really like to be able to control the speed to the tenth of a MPH. But now, by about mile 1.5, the screen is almost completely blacked out. That said, it was cheap, and the running belt is perfectly functional. I would say if you want the cheapest possible option for indoor running during the pandemic, this will work for you. It is great for my basement, which has a very low ceiling and it also works in a very tight space. But it is purely for just jumping on and burning off some calories."
"I notice that running at 6 miles per hour (which should equal 10 minutes per mile), ends up being more than 11 minutes per mile. It's like the distance unit doesn't keep up with the time. Also, the tread seems loose so I have yet to try and tighten. I guess for the price it's good, just keep in mind that you may have to subtract time from the mile you completed. Do a test run and check the half mile and mile times.
Also putting it together was a little tough. The Allen key bolts didn't always line up with the threads so it was tough to thread in and awkward to tighten. This was a two person job to put together because the console part has to slide onto the two legs while connecting the wiring at the same time. Perhaps you could do it yourself if you have two tables with stacks of blocks or something to support the console while you connect the wires. Mine had no instructions by the way, so if you're wondering about which ends to connect, it is black connects to black and red connects to red.
An additional thing I'll mention just for the sake of mentioning it is that this product is from China (which I'm okay with). I mention it because when I opened the package there was a giant Chinese centipede in the corner styrofoam block along with many long centipede legs that had been discarded by other centipedes I guess. Fortunately the centipede didn't move so I assumed it was dead.
Would I recommend this treadmill” sure, the price and small size is good if you can overlook the other things. Hope this was helpful."
Assembled today and used for no more than 20 minutes and trouble code e8 popped up. E8 is not listed in the trouble shoot codes so have to contact tech support. Not happy, not worth it
"The worst experience was getting the damned thing into my house. The package is extremely heavy. Once I managed to get it inside, the removal process was almost slapstick. Then I had to drag it carefully down the basement steps. Once it was (easily) set up and I'd rested for three hours, I gave it a try. It's probably worth MUCH more than the price!
Now...
I was always skinny ” bony skinny. I quit smoking 15 years ago and went from 135 lbs soaking wet (6 feet tall) to 228 sad lbs. I started on August 7 with speed walking and am now trotting at 6 mph. I have horrible shin issues, so I run for 3 minutes at a time. I spend the 4th minute doing push-ups against the handles. I go for 2 miles. Add a better diet, and after 73 consecutive days, I've lost almost 20 lbs. Seriously. I've not missed a single day. It's a great machine that will provide results if you're willing to put in the effort. 22 minutes a day, and I'm almost seeing my manhood again!"
Screen is not turning on, only by unplugging it
"Just delivered today...May 27, 2020
This is my first actual treadmill. With covid19 the gym isnt an option...and with those being the only treadmills I have known. I guess I wasn't sure what to expect.
As for the incline. NOTHING like the gym. It has 3 notches at the bottom of the machine...not very amazing....
Speed only goes up to 9 mph. It said 10.
The motor is louder than expected.
Boyfriend put it together, it seemed quickly. The belt needed alot of adjustment, after a very loud noise we found that out....
It is 8:42 pm EST. It was first used about 2 or so pm today. I used it, my boyfriend (who is 230 lbs and it looked like it might break...so the weight I disagree on)
My 5 year old daughter and 11 year old son all ran and used it.
The price was great. What I expected was gym worthy.
I am not disappointed, because looking at the commercial nortic at about 3 grand...this is a great first treadmill
Incline is not good.
Speed only goes to 9 mph
Motor isnt super quiet
..but not super loud.
It will not turn on without the emergency key...and I make my kids wear it.
All in all. If you are like me. Tired of gaining weight and it's too humid out or heck...I dont want my newly out of shape body flopping all over out in the world.
This is a decent treadmill.
This will end up (if it lasts as one review I read an update on) this will end up being my sons or both kids treadmill one day as I will get my commercial one.
But for now, this works alright and for the price I say It is amazing
It showed out of stock for me on may 15,2020. And finally received it today may 27, 2020.
So not too long to get it."
You may be in the same situation as us. My husband and I were looking for a cost effective way to get exercise. Gym membership was too expensive. We settled on this product and thought we were getting a bargain. However, after 6 months of purchase, the machine keep shutting off after a few moments of use. We called Amazon and the manufacturer only to be told it was past the 3 month warranty. If you want to take a chance, please buy the product. If not, I would suggest a different product from a different manufacturer. This was not a cost effective way for us to exercise, as we had hoped. $300 for now nine months use is still the cost of a gym membership.
I was excited to get this machine because it was space saver; however, it is high maintenance. It consistently makes a loud, squeaky noise when I use it. My husband has to adjust the treads every week. The only other thing that quiets the machine is to keep both hands on the handles. At times, I want to run on the treadmill and not hold on to the handles. The noise it makes does not make this possible. Think twice before purchasing this treadmill. I wish I had not purchased this machine.
"All treadmills are basically the same. What do you have? The treadmill path you walk on and the control panel. So what are you paying for? Mostly, the control panel and all the pre-programmed routines for you. Also, the motor for the path. The more money you spend, the quieter the motor.
So where does this treadmill land? Right about the middle. The belt on the pathway was flexed upward at first, but has since flattened. There are 12 programs you can use to change up your walk routine. The motor is noticeable. While the whole product is stable, it doesn't seem completely solid. There's a bit of wiggle when touching the control pad or the hand rails. With a little finagling you can change the pitch with the manual feet at the base of the treadmill. There are three different angles you can use to intensify your workout.
This treadmill has a small footprint can easily fold up for a smaller footprint. I've already put about 30 miles on it and I believe it's good for at least another 3,000. For the price, it's a good starter treadmill.
Are there better features of other treadmills? I bet there are. Bluetooth? Probably. TV screens? Sure. But what are you really doing here? Walking, right?
The worst thing I can think of so far is that the safety key that kills the machine is already broken. By broken I mean there are two plastic pieces that sandwich a lanyard and the plastic pieces just separated. Nothing a little bit of glue can't fix.
I give this product three stars because while it's a good product, if I need another one in the future I'll more than likely look for an upgraded model or a different unit altogether.
One last note, if it's beautiful outside, then for goodness sakes go walk outside!"
The treadmill is durable and inexpensive which is why it is very popular. The 1st thing you notice once you put the treadmill together is the 3 inch seam in the treadmill belt that goes acroos from left to right that appears as if something is wrong. This is normal, as every model has it. The 2nd thing you notice after using for awhile is that the belt will move to the right or left, depending on which are you are using to hold the bar. If holding the left bar while walking it shifts to the left and vice versa. I tried to adjust the belt by using the adjustment key on the left side and it shifted to center, but once I walked either closer to the right or left side, the belt would also shift to that side. Overall, the treadmill gets the job done for the price, but the belt movement is an issue that most, if not all users will have to deal with and know about, before and after purchasing to correctly asses how ot deal with it.
I called the number inside the shipping box ( Xterra Fitness ) for help as soon as I got the tr150 assembled. I walked on it for 5 or 10 minutes before hearing an unexpected intermittent scraping sound. A quick call to Xterra's service, and a simple walking belt adjustment fixed the problem. I also suggested that I was unable to detect the silicon belt lube when I checked. He said for me use the lube shipped with the unit and said they would replace the lube. Next day I called again and Shane helped me get the tr150 registered. Seemed like a nice helpful company.
So far I only have had this treadmill a week, but I really love it. Exactly what I was looking for. I was lucky enough to catch the delivery men when they walked up to the door so they were nice enough to lean it into the doorway, and all I had to do was pull it in. Treadmill arrived early in the morning and in perfect condition. Beware it is very heavy and I think unboxing is probably the hardest part. Assembly was a breeze and I put it together by myself... 59 year old woman with health issues. Assembly was a snap ðŸ˜Š. I have laminate floors and it did shake a little bit, so I purchased some small padding squares for gym equipment and now it doesn't shake. I took one star off from this product because the front does wiggle a little bit and they should make the frame to console supports deeper so it is more stable. There is no space big enough for a water bottle, but honestly if it was a big issue you could always buy one made for cars and attachment it. It will hold a notebook or phone just fine. I put up a small TV shelf above the treadmill to put my laptop on and it's perfect. If you're looking for an inexpensive treadmill for just everyday walking and light jogging this is a good choice. If you're a professional runner I would suggest you upgrade to a more sturdier model. I live in a studio where space is very limited, this treadmill is very easy to fold up and down. Mine came with a securing strap, because of the reviews saying that the securing pin does not hold well, I use the securing strap as well and also a heavy duty bungee cord.. no issues. The treadmill is also very quiet,the beep is kind of loud but after that, all you really hear are your own footsteps. The belt is a little bit thinner than I expected, but so far it seems fine. Very happy with my purchase.
The Xterra TR 150 treadmill is fairly decent for the price, but there are some drawbacks. For one you have to make sure the belt is perfectly aligned all the time, otherwise it make a horrible moaning sound. Belt adjustments can be a pain and take patience to make sure it's right. The treadmill is small, but by no means compact. It is also quite heavy and not as portable as I would like. It's also a bit difficult to fold. The assembly was fairly easy it took my friend 30 minutes to put together and he did it by himself. The instructions were straight forward, but they were useless when it came to operating the treadmill. I didn't like the fact that there is no backlight to the control panel. The speed can reach up to 10 mph, but I am leary about trying to run on it due to stability of the machine. I mainly plan to use it for speed walking or a light jog. I did call up Xterra customer service and the person I spoke to was very nice and helped with troubleshooting the moaning sound I was hearing from the treadmill. He thought it needed lubricant but again it was the belt alignment that was the problem. In conclusion this treadmill is good ðŸ‘ for the price, but it is by no means great. I just hope to get a couple of years use out of it until I can work up on a better model.
"Okay. I bought this treadmill because I do OTF and I was really struggling to hold myself accountable during quarantine. When I purchased the treadmill, I looked and read through every single review I could possibly find and this tread seemed very hit or miss. Here's my experience: my tread was delivered about 2 weeks earlier than amazon said it would be, which was a major plus. When it arrived, I was able to push the box (I am 5' 1 and 125 lbs) Without any major problems. It was not too heavy to push (maybe too heavy to lift). Putting it together by myself took an hour and six mins, mostly because I couldn't get two of the screws in properly, which took up a lot of time. Otherwise, set up was a breeze and I had no issues.
The tread itself is not as cushiony as my OTF treads (obviously), but as someone with knee issues, I've had no problems or pain running on this. I do not use the manual incline so I can't speak to that, but I do get in about 3 miles per day, running at around 6.0mph. It feels sturdy and it isn't very loud.
Overall, I was looking for a treadmill to tide me over until the pandemic winds down, and I didn't want to spend a ton of money on the machine, considering I likely won't use it often once things resume as normal. If you're looking for an inexpensive alternative and do not mind a tread that lacks the bells and whistles, I would recommend this treadmill any day."
"I do not normally review items unless I have a good reason. I found it very difficult with all the treadmills available deciding which treadmill to purchase. I did quite a bit of research and narrowed it down to the XTERRA Fitness TR150 Folding. I've had it one day and I am very happy & impressed. I will keep my review updated and will reevaluate this treadmill in one month. I hope this will be helpful to all those like myself who found it difficult & confusing when trying to pick the right treadmill that is quiet, works as stated and at a reasonable price.
I was surprised to open the door at 6:30AM this Monday morning to take my dogs out to do their business and find my XTERRA Fitness TR150 Folding treadmill in a cardboard box waiting for someone to open it up and put it to use. I expected to have to wait all day for delivery, nice surprise.
I immediately dragged the treadmill into the house and had it completely set it up and my first 45 minute walk completed by 9AM. Setup was a piece of cake for almost anyone, even with very little skills for assembling such things. The directions were very good, not necessary but very helpful as a reference.
I am thrilled with the treadmill, it was quiet enough that I did not need to raise the volume on my TV and it worked flawlessly out of the box without any adjustments. I like the options to change the speed by the mile or by increase/decrease button. It comes with a safety key that you attach to your clothing in case you ever had an accident and fell off. This would stop the engine and prevent the belt from burning your skin or tubbing on your clothing. I use an Apple Watch and Apple Fitness app, I found the display and my fitness app to be pretty much the same, even though I normally walk outside and not on a treadmill. At this moment I am very pleased with my purchase.
Only Con, that every folding treadmill that I have seen it they fold up in the wrong direction. Making it necessary to have to rotate the treadmill as to not look at the wall when lowered or to get it to face the TV. This is only a problem if you normally fold it up when not in use but all treadmills I have seen, have this flaw."
"I've had this treadmill for one month now and I really love it. I researched a lot of models in various price ranges, but I was hoping to spend less than $600. When I found this model for $400, I did my usual investigating and decided it was a fairly safe choice.
It was delivered when I was home alone so, using leverage and a little physics, I got it in the house, unboxed it, and got it set up without any assistance. I counted that as my workout for the day ðŸ¤£
It's not extremely light, but I don't want something that is going to fall apart as soon as I get it, so I don't mind it being solid. While initially I was looking for something that folds down to go under my couch, I realized those models weren't necessarily going to stand up over time, and found some space in my living room to go with a model like this, where the belt section folds up.
I intermittently walk and jog and the controls on this are very easy to use. I don't need a cup holder, so I'm okay with the fact that it doesn't have one. It does have space to put things like earbuds, cell phones, or other smaller objects, and it has a secure center lip/holder for devices if you want to watch something while you're walking/running. I found that my neck hurt from looking down when I used this too much, so I put some 3M hooks on the wall, at eye level, and just set my device there, with bluetooth earbuds in. This is working great.
The treadmill isn't loud at all, and our three cats aren't bothered by it. The first week, our youngest kitten, a 6-month old, decided to jump in front of me while I was walking on it, and I was able to pull the safety cord, grip one of the handles and grab him so neither of us were hurt. He now recognizes that it's probably best if I'm the only one on the treadmill when it's moving. Needles to say, the safety features ARE helpful and the handles are sturdy.
I don't have particularly good knees, but the cushioning on this treadmill seems to be really great. I've had no pain from hour-long walks, and even the intermittent jogging, the way I do on pavement.
Because I don't have to bundle up, worry about strangers or cars, or wear a mask while I'm breathing heavily, I'm finding it easier to just hop on my treadmill and work off this COVID-19 weight."
I mean you get what you pay for but this is more of a $150 treadmill. I use this for walking and have put 100 miles between me and my wife. I wish I kept the box because the heap would have been returned. Yes assembly is easy, its not heavy that's the only pros. The track is so small that I couldn't imagine using this to run but even walking is a problem to some degree. Can't trace weight and the speed programs stink. If this was cheaper it would've been acceptable. I say If you need a treadmill go on Marketplace on Facebook and buy a used commercial one (seeing how most people hardly use their treadmills) Don't waste the money on this not even if its just for a pet.
"Update 2-6-2021
Still can't reach customer service and return window is closed. If you get a good unit then you're the lucky one because God luck figuring out any issues even with a supposed warranty if they don't reply to calls/emails. It technically works so I'm making due with it. Product gets 3-3.5 stars and customer service gets a 0.
Update 1-21-2021
Still no contact... It's been over a month now and I can't get in touch with anyone. Hate to give a one star rating, but this is pretty insane. I give the product itself a 4, but so l customer service is a zero at this point. Will update when and if I get through.
So, everything about the unit is pretty good, especially if you can snag one for under $300 like I did. I have to knock off a few stars though and I usually don't do this sort of thing, but I'll explain.
Minus one star for the company and one for the products shortcomings. The treadmill itself wobbles a little when walking or running. I tightened the screws more upon noticing this, but it's still not completely stable feeling. Being a self assembly job and it being fairly light weight/compact I get it. I still feel that it could be a little more sturdy. The pulse sensor is questionable at times. Sometimes my walk had a higher heart rate than my run and fluctuated a bit oddly as well in the middle of either activity. A bit of fluctuation is fine, but 20bpm or so seems a bit excessive so I'm not sure how accurate it is. Personally I'm not that concerned about heart rate currently so it's not a deal breaker.
The next issue is the belt. The belt was assembled with a shorter piece than advertised. It's only by 3/8 of an inch, but it's quite noticeable. It can be the difference between catching the edge and slipping while running. The other reason this is even more pronounced is due to the fact the belt is off-center, increasing the gap between the platform and belt.
The last thing I want to touch on is customer service. I haven't been able to get in touch on the phone so I sent an email. That email was sent on December 15th. I have received no reply. I understand it was ten days before holidays, but I figured by now nearly 20 days later I would receive something. Hopefully I will get in contact with them the coming week to find out a resolve to these issues. I honestly just need a new belt as that's my main concern.
For the price I can't fault too much and my expectations aren't insane, but to get the item as intended is all I desire. If I get in touch with the seller then I will consider updating the review to a 4 or 5 star. It functions and it's compact, but the other issues detract from the good."
I have been looking at treadmills for almost a year. I am training for a half marathon and only have free time to run when it's dark out. I only have space in my home for something small, and I was nervous to spend a lot of money and then regret the decision. Finally took the plunge with this and I am SO happy with it! It arrived quickly and Amazon's room of choice delivery was right on schedule. The team member who delivered it was wonderful. It was easy for me to assemble by myself (I am a 5 foot 4 woman). The belt was off center and made an awful noise when I first started it, but I called the number provided. They answered quickly and Jonathan patiently taught me how to center the belt (it's easy once you know how!) and that took care of the issue. Jonathan could not have more professional or courteous. I've used it twice for 30 minute runs and am thrilled. It is a much smaller footprint than gym treadmills, but not so small I feel uncomfortable running above 6.0mph. It holds a small water bottle and my iphone; it's easy to adjust the speed during a workout, and the emergency shutoff works great. The handrails and display are a little wobbly, but that might have been my fault with the assembly. Overall I would recommend this highly for someone looking for a simple treadmill to walk or run.
Loved it when it was working. I received this treadmill on June 15th, 2020 and used it 3-4 time a week. Today is July 27th, 2020 and the screen malfunctions already. Disappointed.
I can't tell you how many fold up treadmills I looked at, and every one seemed way too small to actually walk on. Some of the treads measured so small I thought surely it must be for a child's feet. I don't have small feet and I have a long stride, so when I saw this one with the decent measurements and the decent price, I jumped on it. I am not disappointed. Is it perfect? no. But it does have more good than bad. The good being the large walking tread, so you can walk close, or fall behind a little, and not hit the sides or the back of the mat. It has cups on either side of the console for holding stuff, it has a good speed ratio (up to 9). It folds up into a nice little square space, and is also easy to move around (albeit I did add some small round furniture mover stickers to each corner to protect my floor just in case, which makes it easy to slide, but it does stay in place while using it. The small wheels that came on it are on the back, so it's meant to be kind of lifted up and angled for you to use the wheels and since I found the machine to actually be quite heavy, it works better putting sliders on the corners for me than to lift it to move). Also on that note, you get a bit of a workout in itself just putting this baby up in place and taking it down, as it is not a light machine. This is both good (meaning it is sturdy) and bad (if you can't lift a bit of weight). Also a con, I don't find that the thick metal pin to hold it in its upward position is long enough to feel really secure. I bumped it once when putting it together and it came crashing down, thus I have warned all kiddos to never ever climb under it. I have not had it fall since, but I do keep it up in a corner. Yet I still think it is a hazard if it was not pointed to come down and hit only a wall. But for what it is built and intended for-- walking/running-- it is a great treadmill for the money, with the excellent fold up option for those of us with limited space. I do want to add, though, agreeing with others that the manual incline levers are pretty much useless. In that regard, though, the way the treadmill is set always on level one, it always feels like you are already walking at an incline no matter what. Slight, but noticeable compared to some treadmills I have been on which are completely flat, and others even feel as if you are walking a bit of a downhill until you bring it up. Also to note: unlike alot of other weird brands out there, I didn't have to sign up to any kind of service to get it working or any of that kind of nonsense.
"I bought this treadmill new on sale and for the price, it is the best budget treadmill on the market at the price range.
Pros: 10x speed. I think this is the only budget treadmill that gives 10x speed while other budget ones gives 8x or under.
Easy to maintain. The belt is easy to loosen for lubrication and cleaning. Tightening and centering the belt is just as easy. If the belt shift to the left, loosen a little of the right and vice versa.
Foldable and has wheels for transportation.
Decent running space. This is a huge plus for me because I also use the space for assisted walking lunges. The treadmill arms really help and feels sturdy. Setup is easy.
Cons: slippery on tile floors. To fix this issue, I bought eva 3/4 inch foam to place under the treadmill back side to keep the treadmill from moving. Not sure how it is on carpet.
The incline option is a joke. I don't really need the incline and it doesn't help much.
Inaccurate heart rate monitor and distance is obvious but that is with every budget treadmill and even premium treadmills. If you want an accurate read on your heart rate, the best one is a strap on around your chest. If you dont like straps over chest, heart rate watch is next option.
Even though the monitor is not accurate, I still use it as a measurement of success. For example, I will see how much calories burn or distance ran day1 and next exercise I'll attempt to beat that.
Overall still best budget treadmill on market. 10x speed is a great workout."
"UPDATE: Customer service called on the same day as the initial review below and followed up with email and a prompt shipment of a replacement console. Once installed, everything seems normal and the treadmill has been running great for the last week. They were very helpful and followed up a few times to make sure this corrected the problem.
ORIG REVIEW:
First, I will say the treadmill was delivered quickly, easy to assemble and is excellent for my running purposes. I run often and needed a economic treadmill that could keep pace with a 9 minute per mile speed. This treadmill does the job well.
I contacted the manufacturer immediately after my first run. The display works fine until a few minutes into a run or program, when you change speeds the display is all garbled and LED is impossible to read. I've sent several messages via email and was promised someone would contact me to service the unit. It has now been 15 days since my initial contact, I'm tired of waiting. Please send a service technician or replace this unit. I paid an upcharge for delivery into my apartment, so I would expect someone will come take this one away and I'm not really in the mood to carry it downstairs, box and re-ship something that weighs 120 lbs by myself. I would love to rate this 5 stars becuase I think it runs excellent other than the customer support and repairs needed to LCD display.
Hoping they contact me back and get a tech out to replace the screen soon..."
"First of all, delivery by UPS was fantastic. Box was intact and UPS delivery guy kindly pushed the heavy box beyond entrance door for me. Assembly was a breeze and requires no tool. It can be done by one person but would be easier for two.
The treadmill itself is very basic. It should be noted that the belt is quite narrow and not safe for a tall person to run. For reference, size 5 (mine) and size 12 (my husband's) running shoes are shown in the photo. I had no problem walking on this but I am only 5'3. My husband, on the other hand, is 6'1 and needs to make an effort to stay in center because the belt is barely wide enough for him to stay in.
The treadmill vibrates violently and gets very loud when you get to 4 mph or higher. My husband had a TV remote control on the panel while running, and the remote flew out immediately after he started to run at 4 mph. Treadmill was not falling apart or anything but I doubt it's safe to run on this. You can maybe do light jogging.
You get what you pay for. I will use this treadmill for walking while working but plan to order another treadmill so my husband can run."
"Purchased just over 2yrs ago. It wasn't hard to assemble. We have it in the basement and never folded it up, so I can't comment on related issues I saw in other review. Good budget friendly piece of equipment. BUT it literally dies on me couple weeks ago. The machine kept on beeping and the screen kept flashing. No error code.
According to the tech support on the phone, most likely the controller board is gone! Really, for just over 2 yr.
Well, parts are all in backorder till December, and frankly I don't know if I want to spend that kink of money to get replacement parts and don't know how long it will last."
Got treadmill 2 days ago, let me first say assembly was super easy. Next day dressed in my favorite pair of running shoes and set out to log a few miles and try out the different functions. After a 5 minute warm-up at an average speed 5.5mph I decided to try out the different programs -here's where it all went downhill. I could not get any of the programs to work I would be in a full on run and it would suddenly drop down to 1.5mph. I tried ALL 12 of the program functions. Not one would allow me to get pass 30 seconds before it basically stopped. I tried everything. Finally after complete frustration I turned it off and decided to attempt to contact the company. I did of course read the simple manual that came with the treadmill prior to calling. I put in my number for call back and was never able to connect with anyone. I need to be bikini ready in a little over a month and things are not looking good. How do you do a return/refund? New monitor piece...something?? Sincerely, A frustrated retired runner.
"So, I bought this in an apartment. I am a medium-distance runner - 4-6 miles usually 3-5 times per week.
I bought it and ran a few times on it. To be totally frank, I felt like I was hurting the treadmill every time that I ran on it. I am about 6'0, 195lbs - so a good-sized guy. The frame was shaking with every step, and I literally was tensing up as I ran because I thought that I was hurting it. Also, the belt did require some adjustment every few runs - it was sticking pretty bad every time it got comfortable.
I got tired of the belt sticking, so I called their customer support. No answer, so I left a message. A few days later, I called and left another message. Three messages later, still no call-back. Their customer support is either under-manned, or just ignoring their messages maybe?
I ended up returning it and getting a NordicTrack 6.5S . It costs more, but it was definitely worth the difference in quality.
Again, for a walker, I'm sure this would do just fine. However, for a runner, I don't recommend it. Spend a few more bucks and just get the nicer NordicTrack."
"You need two people to move the 100 pound box when it arrives - be aware! Unpacking and assembly was very simple. There are simple bolts that hold the uprights to the treadmill and another set that hold the control panel to the uprights. That's it. It took me around 30 minutes to put it together, after I unpacked it. The only slightly confusing part was connecting the control wires, which travel up through the right-hand upright from the treadmill to the control panel. And you need to be careful inserting the bolts so as not to trap the wires.
The treadmill works as you'd expect. it isn't particularly noisy, and there is little 'bounce' from the track. It's rated up to 250 pounds, so I was OK (pre-COVID weight!). The programs they include really aren't all that much use. They speed up and slow down the treadmill in a pattern - you can see the patterns printed on the control panel in my photos. I use it just for steady walking, and it has been great for that. I walk one hour a day at 3mph, and so far that hasn't produced any problems.
I was disappointed after just a few days to see the LUBE warning light come on. In theory, you should need to apply treadmill (silicone) lube under the belt after about 40 hours of operation. The light came on after six! But I followed the instructions and used the lube they supplied. I immediately ordered more - you may want to do that same. I suspect it was just dry coming from the factory. So far the warning hasn't come back, after about 10 more hours of walking. (HINT: Having lubed the track, press and HOLD the ENTER key to clear the warning on the display. I missed that in the instructions!)
My other criticism would be the lack of anywhere to safely put a water bottle. You can see I've balanced one in the pictures. There are four indents around the control panel - the lower one on each side is barely big enough for coins - and I don't go through many toll-booths while walking in my bedroom - so they're pretty useless. There IS room for them to modify this to allow space for a water bottle, so I don't know why they designed it this way.
The display is clear, and easy to use. There isn't much side-to-side 'wobble' when walking - I don't run, so I can't say how stable it would be for that that.
Folding it up is easy enough, but moving it is not easy. The wheels are really in the wrong place - if you tip it to engage them, it's really hard to steer it where you want it to go. I'd recommend two people for moving it. And though it folds, it won't fit in my bedroom closet - you'd need deep closets to get it in and close the door.
There is a three position ""INCLINE"" built in. Really, they could save themselves the money on the two bits of plastic that do it. it's completely useless. It raises and lowers the end of the treadmill by no more than 2 inches. I can't really detect any difference with that raised or lowered.
Overall, this is an excellent piece of equipment, especially for the money. I do worry about long term maintenance - I'll update this as and when that happens. The instructions talk about regularly removing the motor cover and vacuuming out any dust... I haven't tried that yet.
UPDATE 9/9/20: I've been walking 3 miles a day since May (over 300 miles total), and so far, aside from the occasional odd noise, the treadmill has been rock solid. I've had to lube the belt a few times, and had to adjust the tracking once (very easy - just follow the directions in the manual). Still very happy with this purchase!"
This is a great treadmill for the price (I paid $350). It is easy to use and fairly quiet. There are 2 holders for a phone or a TV remote. I set up an adjustable table next to it so I can have a drink handy. I wanted something that could fold up, be moved easily, but had enough weight to it to feel substantial. It was easy to put together and it is fairly easy to move. The wheels help with moving it, but it has some weight to it (it's about 100 pounds). Also, when folded, the platform is at an angle, so it sticks out a little (it is wider at the top). The purpose was to use during the pandemic, until I can get outside again. I am very active outdoors, spring-fall. I have a gym membership, and access to a gym in my community, but do not want to use public facilities right now. I wanted this just to get through the winter, but it is actually much better than I hoped for. I spent a day reading reviews on different sites, and this was consistently recommended for an under $500 treadmill.
"I had the same issue as others where the LUBE error wouldn't clear after holding the Program button in for 3 seconds, as the sticker recommends. I called customer support and found the fix. Hold in the Enter key for a few seconds, then pull out the red safety key, replace the red safety key, and then release the Enter key. That should do it!
On a whole I love this little treadmill, especially given its price. It seems to be doing the job!"
We have had several treadmills over the years at various price points. We use them for walking not running. We look for units that have the largest motor and belt in a moderate price category. We do not need/want a lot of electronics or fluff. This unit is all that. Delivery was quick, package was not damaged. Item is fairly heavy, may need two people to place it. Assembly is straight forward. Should be less than an hour regardless of your mechanical skills. Almost took longer to remove from the box than to assemble. Couple of screws, plug in the electronics and you are off. Although the speed can adjust high enough for a runner, a dedicated runner may want a larger motor and larger belt. Also the incline is mechanically adjusted and not really noticeable. Purchased the extended warranty since I didn't know what to expect without seeing the product and having to deal with a repair from an on-line purchase. Happy with the product. Would recommend and purchase again.
The product worked for one week. After that it required oil on the belt and all kinds of error codes appeared. Contacted Amazon and they contacted the manufacturer to reset the codes. After the second week it stopped working completely. Contacted Amazon again and they contacted manufacturer to establish that it needs a new motor and that they will send technician to replace it. Technician never showed up. Call Amazon again and they did not want to accept return. So, they contacted manufacturer again and they said all they can do is send technician again. It has been over two months. This is a scam from Amazon and from Xterra. Do not buy any xterra products on Amazon
"Edit: sticking with 4 stars. Some things I've noticed now that I've had this a while:
1) Mileage/calorie calculations definitely seem off, especially against what my FitBit shows. But running at a 5.5 pace should net me a mile in just under 11 minutes, and it seems like I actually have to run closer to 5.7 to get that, so even the speed settings seem a bit off. Not a deal breaker, but something to be aware of.
2) not all the screws seated fully, so there was a spot where a washer was jangling against the metal that was driving me nuts. I taped it down, but would have liked to see it assemble as intended.
3) it definitely isn't silent as it runs--there is a bit of whirring from the motor and the impact noise is definitely noticeable between the deck and how it shakes the display assembly. For the price, I kind of expected such, though.
Overall, still happy with my purchase. I wanted a treadmill that would fit in the small space I had available (which it does) and I needed it to go fast enough for proper running/sprints (which is does). A basic treadmill for basic needs--not perfect, but since I'm still not back to my gym, it's just what I need!
--------
I'm going with 4 stars for now, as I haven't really put it through its paces yet, so I'll come back after I do and adjust up or down, depending on how things go.
I just received the treadmill today (a day early!). So I wanted to at least review on how it arrived (in perfect condition!) and first impressions for anyone who might be on the fence (as I was) about making the leap and purchasing this.
This thing is HEAVY. I honestly thought I could get it to the second floor of my house alone. No. You will need a buddy to lift this bad boy.
My box came, and was in perfect condition. No dents/tears to the box. Once my buddy helped my get it upstairs and I unboxed, I was really impressed with the packaging. Corners were well-protected, and everything arrived looking great. I'd been a bit nervous based on a few other reviews, but my experience of how it arrived was fabulous.
I was able to unbox it and assemble it alone. A couple quick hiccups in assembly: one side of the cable you have to attach hadn't been tethered to stay where it was easily accessible (it looks like they meant to and forgot or it slipped free) so the cable had fallen into the support tube and I had to fish it out with a chopstick. (Hey, whatever works in these times, am I right?). Took just a few seconds and not a huge issue at all. The other hiccup (and this seems to be just a reality of owning a treadmill) is I has to adjust the belt a bit, as once I started it running, it seemed to be to be a bit close to the left side. Again, easy enough to fix!
Everything feels about as sturdy as I expected, if not morso. Nothing really seemed to jiggle as I walked or jogged on it. No weird squeaking, as I think one reviewer mentioned. The silicon lubricant that came with had leaked a bit, but it was packed securely in a separate baggie, so no biggie!
I have a FitBit, so the distance/calorie/heartrate calculations, if they are off, won't be that upsetting to me as they seem to be for other reviewers.
Fingers crossed this thing gets me through COVID! I bought it as my gym is currently closed and I don't see myself going back right away once it does open. And running outside has been feeling like such a pain with our local weather being all over the place, people being all over the place (suddenly everyone is outside, and everyone must walk in the exact center of the sidewalk), and lots of folks in my local neighborhood getting hostile toward runners, in general, but especially those who don't wear a mask (I cannot run with mask--kudos to those who can). So if this baby lasts 6 months for regular jogging/walking, I'll consider it money well spent."
"For starters, the treadmill works in its most basic function. The belt moves, isnt terribly loud, and serves that purpose.
Now, the ""incline"" that it supposedly has is useless, id argue its more of a decline actually. On its ""highest"" setting, its complet level to the naked eye, throw a level on it and you might get that bubble to move up some. Overall its a useless feature (no I don't care that its manual to adjust, that isn't my concern here).
The screen on it is also becoming useless, like many others have complained about. 14 days in and it only works when it wants to. A basic LCD screen like this shouldn't go out in 14 days. My 20 year old car (digital) odometer works just fine, so whats the problem here? Shotty work at best.
Overall it gets a 2 of 5. And thats only because it performs walking/jogging. If thats all it said it did I would give it a 5 of 5. Don't add (basic) features if they arent going to work from the get-go."
My treadmill was dropped purposely off the back of the Amazon delivery truck, despite clear markings "do not drop", right before my eyes. It hasn't worked since it arrived, despite great customer service from the manufacturer. I am waiting for a new motor to be installed on my never-been-used machine and really wish it was not taking up space in my living room. Amazon suggested I put it back in the box (basically impossible) and return it and wait 6 weeks for another one to show up on the same issue-laden delivery truck. While I wait for my existing treadmill to become functional, my whole family has become immune to its presence and have learned to ignore it before it is possible to use it. Disappointed in Amazon's delivery service and will not be buying large, "handle delicately" things via Amazon again. manufacturer seems great. I would buy direct. so very frustrated.
We bought the treadmill and received a defective unit that made screechy sounds. We tried calling XTERRA Support and every time were on hold for over an hour. I eventually had the idea of calling the XTERRA sales support, and low and behold, they picked up right away. Apparently they only want to sell you units but not help you once they sold you the defective ones. At the end of the day, they wanted us to pay for labor or the parts and we refused since the product did not work properly from the beginning. I would not risk buying from them. The treadmill is affordable but you get even less than what you pay for... cheap/defective product and no customer service!
"OK i'm back with my follow up review this treadmill is great and the company stood behind its word and sent a tech out it took awhile for the tech to come but all is good now i hope i get many walking yrs out of this treadmill...thank you xterra ...update 01/14/19
well lube warning is showing up....
they are sending a technician out and a part or parts...its a heavy machine and i knew that when i made the purchase and that part was OK .but sending it back is the issue..also in the book for this treadmill it states to LUBE it after 40 hours of use well i haven't had the treadmill a month and i walk only a half hour on most days and there has been some days haven't use the treadmill at all so there is NO WAY i've accumulated 40 hours of use...i will up date if the company Rectifys the problem ..or this is a huge paper weight..."
"I purchased this product in December 2018. It wasn't the best treadmill, nor was it the worst - it did its job. However, after about three months of ownership, this treadmill has the words ""Lube"" on it dictating that I put more lube on it. Though, I have already put a good bit more lube on it twice now and have followed the instructions to reset it the word ""Lube"" will not go away.
I would like to return this product and get my money back since it is defective. I recommend not purchasing this product."
After struggling for years with second-hand treadmills I finally broke down and bought this new one. I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews. I do not train for marathons. I needed an easy-to-use treadmill that was not exorbitantly priced that I can jump on for 30 minutes a day for interval walking/running. Also I was looking for something that didn't weigh 7 tons and was easy to assemble. Thank you to everyone who wrote a review about easy assembly of this treadmill. It most certainly was. Directions were correct, extremely basic and this treadmill was assembled in 20 minutes without my husband threatening divorce even once. I LOVE it. Besides easy assembly the thing I love most is how quiet it is! It's virtually silent rather than sound like a thrashing machine. (Normally I've had to have the television turned up to full column plus closed captioning on.) I couldn't be more satisfied with this treadmill for the price I paid.
"I really like this treadmill for what it is. Its not a super nice treadmill like you see at the gym, but its also not $2k. For the price this is a really nice machine.
It has very limited incline, probably about a .5 but has the speed range you'd need for whatever level of runner you are. It tells you when it needs lubricant, which comes with the machine (score!). My fiance and I each average 4-6 miles a day on it and have had the treadmill for about 3 weeks and are just now needing to use the lubricant. It was super easy for us to put together, took maybe 20 minutes including unpacking it.
Things to note: I will say that occasionally it sounds loud while you walk on it, but this is usually only for a few minutes at a time and typically when you're just starting it up. The noise eventually stops on its own and its pretty quiet. The frame will shake if you're running, but seems stable enough.
All in all I'm really happy with the purchase and I would recommend to others based on my experience. For the price point this was definitely a great add to our home gym."
"This Treadwell is basic but it just does the job for me, which is to fast walk. It is portable and relatively light. The real joke is it has elevation setting but it hardly adds any height, probably 1 inch.
After nearly 2 years, the treadmill stopped working giving me the error message E6 meaning most likely have to replace the motherboard. I called the company customer service and Jonathan was most gracious helping me to order the appropriate motherboard was costing around hundred dollars and gave me the conference replace it myself. I'm waiting for it. And greatly appreciate Jonathan's help.
Because this is a moving item I bought a square trade insurance through Amazon. So that one has come handy and offered a cash prize of the value of the treadmill one time without any for the insurance."
I am not a hardcore fitness addict. I have been hitting the gym regularly since July, but they decided to up my membership in January, so I said "screw that" and decided to purchase my own treadmill. I've used this a few times and I'm pleased. It's very basic, which is fine for me. It seems sturdy, and my boyfriend says it's pretty quiet (I wear noise-canceling headphones when I jog, so what do I care?? :) ). It doesn't have a holder for water, which is bizarre to me, but since I'm at home, that's no big deal to me. It's not very wide, so your foot placement has to be pretty on-point, but it's long, which fits a good, long stride. Overall, very happy with this purchase, and I think the price is fair for what you're getting.
Ordered during the thick of the pandemic when shipping was delayed, I didn't expect to get my treadmill for more than a month, particularly since it appeared on Amazon as 'currently unavailable' when I put in my order. It came surprisingly quickly, I believe in less than a month. The assembly was easy, and I was able to do it without help. It has operated well even with daily use, and folds reasonably easily. The placement of the wheels to roll it into a storage corner or space is a little perplexing though. Since the running belt folds up toward the console, it would have made sense to have the wheels in the front, but no ... they're in the rear which makes moving it once folded a little difficult. Other than that, I have no complaints, I get a gym-quality walk/run on this machine and recommend it.
"Update: 11 months after purchase
Treadmill is dead. Motor issues. I lubricated it on a regular basis and did all the basic maintenance but it is now dead. Lowering my rating to 2 stars.
Just got it today and spent 30 minutes on it.
1) Very easy to assemble. I did it alone, took about 20 minutes. Putting the top piece on is a little awkward to do alone but it is very light and doable.
2) I'm just over 200 pounds it was solid for a light jog. Didn't run on it yet. I found it comfortable to jog on though keep in mind the track is not wide (I wander a bit sometimes so need to pay attention so I don't go to much to the side)
3) in terms of noise it was good. About what I'd expect.
4) the beeps when hitting buttons are kinda high pitched (a little annoying) but not a big deal.
5) great value for the price.
6) lifting the base up to fold is easy and it secures very well (not concerned with it dropping).
I bought this specifically for the quarantine due to Coronavirus (building gym is closed) and it seems like it will do the trick.
If I have any issues I will update this post in the next week or so.
Overall, I recommend this for light joggers or people just looking to get their steps in."
I bought this treadmill so I would have a way to continue running through the fall and winter without going outside in the cold. It gets the job done. My main problem with this is that after having it for only about a month or so, the pixels on the information screen are starting to screw up. They're bleeding down into the information displaying calories, miles run/walked, etc. (By the way, calories burned is INCREDIBLY overestimated and miles are greatly underestimated). I'm concerned that this problem will get worse as time goes on and will render the screen useless.
I love this treadmill. Pleasantly surprised by the quality and sturdiness. I am a 5'6 female, and weigh 206 pounds. 52 years old. It was straightforward and simple to put together. However, for me, getting it out of the box was the hardest part. I did it by myself. With another person, it would have been a breeze. Plus, I have limited space, so I had to move slowly and carefully. Took me about 3 hours. The treadmill is of very good quality. Sturdy, solid construction. It's relatively quiet. With music on, I can't hear the treadmill. I had to adjust the tread belt tracking. It was going towards the right. It was very simple. Follow the instructions in the owner's manual. Use the Allen wrench provided. Make tracking adjustments on the left side bolt, back of the treadmill. A little goes a long way. Make 1/4 turns, then check. I made this adjustment on the first day, and I've had no further issue with the tread belt. So far, I've used this treadmill 5 times in the 5 days that I've owned it. I mostly speed walk, going up to 4, and I've jogged on it. As heavy as I am, it does not shake, and I find the track to be comfortably cushioned. When folding it up, and using the safety lock, I think the pin could be a little longer. It's a bit on the short side, so I pay extra attention to that little pin, that is holding everything up. I don't take my eyes off of it when I'm moving the treadmill around to put it away. I also place it against and towards the wall just in case. I have two cats, and I don't want to find a smashed puddy underneath a fallen treadmill. The pin has not popped out, I'm just being super careful because it's a small pin. This treadmill is a really good deal to be under $400. I would highly recommend it. If anything changes, I will update the review.
Lube msg won't go off. I've lubed it and followed instructions in the manual to hold down "program" for three seconds to make lube msg go away. It's blocking the whole screen with "LUBE" I can see many others have this issue because I'm reading in the q & a here. Now it isn't running at the right speeds. I have put less than 10 hrs WALKING on this treadmill. It will say I'm going 5.7 mph but I'm really Going around 3
I received this treadmill, and it is a nice treadmill. It is advertised as one that will track calories and pulse, but it does not. The calorie counter is not adjustable to weight or anything else, and the pulse monitor does not work at all. I contacted customer service by email because they cannot be reached by telephone. After a series of emails, I was told that the pulse monitor does not work, that it is a known issue, and that I should buy my own pulse monitor. Since I had paid for one as it was advertised, I asked if they could send me one, send a replacement for the treadmill, or reimburse me for my cost of buying my own. Their answer was that, although they are knowingly selling faulty equipment, they will do nothing.
This treadmill was bigger and heavier than expected. It was like a regular size treadmill. The board lifts up ok, but it's a little heavy. There's a peg that pulls out and then releases once the board is pulled up to secure it in place. It's (the board) not at a complete vertical up and down position when pulled up. It is somewhat angled. I would recommend having a big space before considering, unless you don't mind having a treadmill take up a small room. I have small bedrooms, so I had to move this to the garage. Super heavy, I'd recommend 2 people to move it. The functionality is ok. This doesn't have a ton of bells and whistles. You get the speed, pulse reader, calorie counter, and program speeds. The only issues I noticed were the belt kept moving to the left which I messaged Amazon support. They told me to use a 3mm Allen wrench to loosen the screw at the bottom 1/4th a turn to center the belt. It was super noisy, and after closer observation, I think the cover ontop of the board was to tight and rubbing against the belt. I gave this a 4 out of 5 because it works, but it's not perfect. I'm not going to the gym during covid so, this is the best I can do right now.
I researched for over 2 months all the treadmills here and at other stores. I am older and just wanted a nice simple unit that I could adjust as needed for speeds and elevations. I finally decided on this one based on a review a gentleman did on U tube - it helped me see better the size, how it worked etc. I am very happy with this treadmill. I can adjust my speed in increments of .5 which was vital to me but oddly enough most treadmill descriptions don't clarify those increments they only talk about how slow and top speed. It doesn't feel flat and seems to have a very slight built-in elevation in addition to the ones you can adjust. But it is not enough to affect my workout. It comes already lubed but include a little bottle of lube and directions on how and when to use it. Putting it together was super easy and no chips, error codes or anything like that.
I REALLY like this treadmill! I did tons of research and this was by far the best quality one based on reviews for the price. I set it up in this tiny space next to my desk at home. It's pretty heavy (two man job for sure) but the assembly was VERY easy! I did it all by myself as a s/m woman. The arms are slanted which was a big negative for me, but I figured out a way to stabilize a DIY desk on this treadmill if that's also your plan. I have both run and walked on this and it works amazing for both! It even comes with a free bottle of lube, easy instructions and there's a reminder on the dash haha. I plugged it into a surge protector and it's set up over carpeting. Can't say enough great things!!
"I typically do not review items however this one is dangerous! Item came in quickly however the belt had a horrible slip. I initially got on the treadmill to try it out and immediately noticed it. I almost slipped and fell on a moving treadmill. I made sure everything was assembled correctly, called to express my concern and get any tips. My husband came home a few days later and attempted to run on the treadmill and the same thing happened only this time it slipped and he actually fell nearly hurting himself and cracking his mouth open on the handle.
Do not purchase this item. It has now been returned for over a week and my account has yet to be reimbursed by the seller or amazon. The status doesn't even say its been picked up. Almost $400 that I am not fighting to get back. I am grateful that none of us got severely hurt! It would be nice to receive my refund so we can purchase a much safer product."
"If you are looking for budget Treadmill with necessary features and great quality then XTERRA TR150 is absolutely worth considering. It is a basic treadmill but works great for your family. It is compact and fits in small space perfectly. Set up process hardly took 15 minutes or so and instructions are very clear as well. My wife and I are using it almost 1 and half our a day. Motor is pretty quite and I can watch my iPad or even read while walking on it.
During product delivery ""Motor Top Cover"" was broken though it did not hinder regular exercise. I contacted Customer Care by email and within 15 minutes Stanford from Sprint Fitness replied back asking for shipping address. Stanford immediately placed the order without asking a single question and part was delivered within 3 days. I am pleased to have this treadmill purchased because both the product and customer service is solid and trusted."
I bought this treadmill as a birthday gift for my sister who lives in a small condo. My son assembled it for her as I handed him the washers and screws. He said it was easy to assemble; only took him 30 minutes including unpacking the product. My sister really likes the treadmill so far! She uses it almost everyday. She says it feels sturdy and she likes the variety of choices for workout routines. As it has been less than 3-weeks since she received the treadmill, I will update the review if there are any significant changes in it's quality or performance in the future. I also bought a 2-year extended warranty for this product.
"I paid $367 for the TR150 Treadmill when I purchased it in May 2020. I really like this treadmill. I live in Las Vegas where it is far too hot to walk outside in summer months. The treadmill is easy to set up and doesn't take up a lot of space as far as treadmills go. It's too heavy for me to fold up. I'm a 65 year old female. This is great buy, especially at the price I paid for it.
Update: I just wanted to add that after I lubricated it for the first time all of the calibrations changed. The speed and distance was way off. I called customer service and they said that sometimes after the treadmill is lubricated it adjusts the measurements to the metric system. Seems like their should be a simple way to correct this but they said they would send out a new unit (just the part that controls the treadmill) in about a month. They said a technician would come out to install it. They also offered to replace the entire treadmill but I opted to keep it so that I could still use it while waiting for the operating unit, whatever that is called. I was really pleased at the customer service and am hoping they live up to their commitment."
I got this treadmill because the gyms are closed during the pandemic and the weather was too cold and rainy to walk/run outside. It was easy to assemble (but the box is heavy keep in mind). The only problem I have is that no matter how much I increase the speed, the belt never seems to go any faster. Not sure if I am doing something wrong but it seems to move slow as molasses. Weather is getting nicer so I'll just utilize the outdoors but it is what it is. It was cheap and will be good for when it's snows and I can't go to the gym. I don't regret my purchase just wish I could figure out why it is so slow.
I took my time reading reviews and comparing the specs of different folding treadmills for my small apartment before deciding to buy this one, and I'm so happy with my decision!!! Being almost 6' tall and 200 lbs, the most important criteria for me were the length of the running surface and the machine's weight capacity. (Noise wasn't a concern since I live on the ground floor of my building, but it turned out to be fairly quiet anyway.) The belt length and width are absolutely perfect for my stride; and the machine itself feels sturdy even when I run on it, despite being closer than I'd like to be to the weight limit. Display and programs are exactly my preferred level of tech - functional with no extra bells or whistles. I was able to put it together by myself in about half an hour's time. I do agree with other buyers that the pulse reading seems off, but for me that's not particularly important. It's pretty easy to tell when your heart rate is elevated without any external feedback. lol. Over all, this may be the best purchase I've ever made on Amazon, and that's saying something!
"I needed something I could use indoors during the cold winter months and the blistering hot summer days. I'm not a runner but i wanted something that was at least capable of it in case I worked my way up to it. So far walking and lite jogging works great for me on this treadmill.
I will average about 3 miles (1hour) daily so far and its very easy to do so on this treadmill. After 6 months of use, I did encounter a lube error which is a part of the regular maintenance. I had trouble clearing the error message as the manual states to hold down the program button to do so. I saw online that others stated it was the enter button instead. I tried this too but it didn't work. I went onto the Xxterra website, registered the warranty and then proceeded to call support about 2 or 3 hours afterwards.
Support was very helpful, calm and patient. They couldn't find my registration so they helped by manually processing the information on the spot and proceeded to help with the lube error code. It was in fact the enter button, it cleared and the treadmill is as good as new.
All in all, I would say this is a great treadmill for the price and for beginner runners/joggers or those just looking to get that extra bit of activity in their day to day lives.
Pros:
- Easy to set up
- Easy Maintenance
- Good quality
- Folded position takes up half the space it does when not folded
- Can be easily moved about in folded position, the frame has wheels
- Tablet shelf on treadmill securely holds cellphone or tablet to pass the time faster
- Lots of programed options for varied workout
- Great customer support!
- Great price
Cons: (I would consider these trivial)
- lack of a cup holder
- The shelf that holds tablets in place as a bit of an edge that covers the bottom of the device, a bit annoying but can be resolved by sticking a pencil or something in there to bump up the tablet
- The tablet shelf also covers the speed controls and display. would be nice if i could view these and the tablet at the same time.
- a usb port to keep phone or tablet charged would be nice
- incorrect lube code instructions in manual"
I was very skeptical with this purchase and after spending the amount, was nervous I'd regret it. However, I'm impressed so far. I've only used it twice but so far so good. I was looking for something that wouldn't be extremely expensive, would be reliable and small enough to fit in my apartment. I took several pictures to give a good idea for anyone unsure about how it would turn out. Fair warning, the box is pretty heavy when delivered which should be expected. It took about 15-20 minutes to assemble with two of us. It's perfect if you're looking for a basic, simple treadmill. Only con I have so far is the incline, which is kind of nonexistent but otherwise I'm very pleased with this purchase and happy with the price.
We've only had it for 2 days so take that into consideration but so far it is excellent. It is not fancy with special features but just a good solid treadmill with a large belt area and a very quiet motor. I'm 230 lbs and it works good for me but I only use for walking. It has 12 programs to choose from but for now we just use in manual mode. Speed adjust is quick and easy. If you want significant incline look for another machine and be ready to pay more than double. So far this is a well made solid basic treadmill and does all that we need. It is very sturdy and solid when I use it. I have every reason to believe it will last for a number of years.
"You get a lot for this price. Period. For a moment, I was intimidated to put it together but all it took was 12 bolts and 12 washers. The hardest part apart from the weight (which any two people can lift up a staircase) was making sure the cable that leads to the console was sticking out on both ends of the vertical bar. It comes with a bottle of silicone lubricant but you could clearly see on mine that it's pre-lubed prior to shipping. On that note, it has an automated message that will tell you when to lube the machine and a maintenance schedule log on the back of it's manual.
Also make sure you read the instructions, there's an on and off switch at the bottom but you won't need to touch that after flipping it on unless you're planning to move the treadmill. It turns off automatically after a period of no use.
As far as usage, I'm 195 lbs and I can go a full spring on this motor AND there's room to go faster. The 2.25 HP motor provides more than sufficient power. As for the preset programs, app I hear about, and the pulse reading -- I've yet to test them but as a basic treadmill this is probably the best treadmill below 400. Also it doesn't look cheap by any means. It's a good looking treadmill with solid, metal parts, and the blue trim is a great bonus."
I was looking for a compact treadmill that folds up for my small office. I saw a bigger model of the XTERRA at Academy and decided to look at the reviews on Amazon. I saw that they had a folding/compact version with very high reviews and for a great price. After much googling and reviewing other makes and models, I decided to purchase the XTERRA TR150. Unpacking and putting it together was pretty easy and took me about 2 hours. Putting the display panel took two people. I've enjoying walking on it almost daily and hope that it will keep me in-shape. The lubrication display came on and the procedure for lubrication the belt was pretty straight forward. Resetting the display on the unit was incorrect but found the correct instructions in one of the reviews: Hold the Enter key, pull out the red safety key, replace the red safety key, and then release the Enter key. Overall, I'm very happy with the treadmill. It's very easy to fold down when needed and back up when not in use. It takes up very little room in my already small office. I highly recommend this unit for someone who needs a compact treadmill for a reasonable price.
My wife wanted a small treadmill for walking, when the outside weather won't permit it. Read the reviews (negative 1 & 2 star) and then did some additional research. Xterra is based in the US (in Arkansas) and they have a website with a host of resources, plus an 800 number for assistance. Was able to read the Owner's Manual before purchasing. Received unit today - was very well packaged. Assembly was very easy (took longer to unbox than to assemble). Plugged in and unit started right away - did NOT receive any error messages, as was a common complaint (made sure the safety key was in place first). Folds easily, and fits easily through our bedroom door (29" wide clearance) with ample room. Feels very sturdy and runs quietly. A very adequate product for our purposes (walking, not running). Would purchase again.
I got this machine for almost 2 years. I've used it lightly for max of 30 minutes each run... the machine is almost new. Yesterday, when I use it, I got an error E6. The manual doesn't help much. I've vacuum and clean up all the dirt, and lubricated it.. still no help. I then call the service department, and they told that once you got error E6, the machine is basically dead. You need to replace the controller and parts that basically cost about the same as the cost of the machine itself. Not a good investment.. I would recommend to save your money $ and buy something that last longer!!
My belt tore within a couple of weeks of using this, within the return video. With Amazon's assistance, I was able to reach Xterra directly and they sent me a new belt and told me a tech would schedule an install within 3-4 business days. After Amazon signed off, and a couple of weeks passed without hearing from them, I finally called them again. Was told they would not be sending anyone out "due to the pandemic". So everything they said (with Amazon customer support listening in) was completely bogus. They never intended to send anyone. They told me to call back "after the pandemic". Hahahahahaha. WTF? Return window now closed, of course. This company cannot be trusted. They don't keep their word, plain and simple.
"I'm happy with this purchase. But there were a few disappointments I didn't see detailed in the reviews, so here they are:
1) The arms are not supportive, you can't lean on them.
2) Programs/Pre-sets are not adaptive. Let's say you are on a 2-speed interval program with a low of 1.8 and a high of 3.0. If you speed up the slow to be 2.5, it will not remember this. It will go to the ""fast"" 3 as scheduled and then back down to 1.8 instead of your preferred 2.5. But most of the programs have like 6 speeds and you have to manually adjust each change over and over. I basically skip the presents and use the short cut speed buttons. Those I like very much.
3) Doesn't track YOUR calories. That is, it doesn't ask your weight. I don't know for what weight person it is making the calculations. It is still useful for comparing workouts, but not for diet tracking (e.g. it won't tell you when you've burned enough to make up for that donut you are earlier)
For the price, I can live with these issues."
I like the treadmill, but it was not easy to put together for one person I imagine if I had two people it would have been a better experience. I like the style I like the size, although it is bigger than I expected it seems to be a very good quality.
This treadmill replaced a 19 year old Pro Form treadmill that finally wore out it's motor, but proved to be faithful and rugged to the end. I did a lot of research for the replacement. Though somewhat smaller than the Pro Form, this machine's components appear to be as sturdy, and of similar build quality but nearly at less than half the price. It is truly well packaged, and easy to assemble. At my age I intend to limit my usage to walking limits, so the machine might very well outlast me.
"I'm in the process of returning the treadmill I bought and Amazon Customer Service has be fantastic in assisting me with this. I bought the treadmill based on the user reviews and ratings. Almost 3,000 people have bought it. And kind of figures that I would get a lemon out of the bunch. So here's how it went.
The Treadmill's total weight is about 108lb. So getting the base out of the box was a little tricky but right away I noticed that the hard plastic at the end was damaged despite being protected by the Styrofoam. I was willing to live with it, getting it back in the box would be really annoying to have it replaced. But then the screws didn't all fit in the holes for the arms and so the arms and console area were really flimsy and honestly, not safe. Someone else mentioned in their review that they had to go and get new screws. Sorry but I just spent over $400 on this, I'm not buying screws on top of the other damage.
To fold the treadmill you lift the treadmill belt itself up and use the pull lever attached to the arm to hold it in place. And then with the treadmill belt in your face, you tilt it toward you to engage the wheels. This seems a bit like a bad design - it was not easy to move around and barely fit the doorways. With the arms as they were with the bad screws it won't take much for the belt to fall on top of my head if the arm slipped out of place.
I would not recommend the treadmill for anyone that needs to be able to easy move it for storage. But if you have a designated space where it will be kept, then you'd probably be fine."
"I'm a runner who struggles with getting through the long Minnesota winters. I used to run at an indoor track but I hesitated for a long time on buying a treadmill because I just assumed a decent one would be $1000+.
I couldn't believe the price of this treadmill, but I read the reviews and decided to give it a chance. All I was really looking for was something basic. I'm not interested in adjusting the incline or complex workouts ” I just want to be able to set a pace and go.
This treadmill is great for that. It's compact but ""big enough"" ” it doesn't take up much space, but it doesn't feel cramped when you're on it. It has some program features I've never even tried, but it's super easy to turn on, set a speed and start walking or running. It's solid and heavy enough that it feels secure and stable whether you're walking or running. (I weigh 160 pounds.)
Assembly was very easy. The only problem I had was that the provided bottle of silicone lubricant (yes, it was provided, despite what some other reviews said!) had leaked all over the inside of the bag of hardware.
This treadmill is technically ""portable"" in that it folds down and has wheels to roll it into a closet or whatever, but it is VERY heavy (as it needs to be), so I recommend finding a spot for it and leaving it there. We have it in our basement in a place where it doesn't need to be moved. The FedEx delivery truck dropped it off by our garage without coming to the door ” luckily we were home at the time ” and we had to use a dolly to wheel it to the house. Carrying it is definitely a two-person job!
Anyway¦ once you have this treadmill where you want it and get it set up, which doesn't take much time, I think you'll be very pleased with it, as we are. Spring is here and I'm back to running outside, but I am happy to know that I'll have a reliable way to run next winter, or whenever there's bad weather! And it was only the cost of a few months' gym membership!"
The extra large 70 pound box with treadmill inside arrived on time. It took a bit of effort to get into the house since I did not have any help and there was only one shipping strap to grab onto. Good instructions made it easy to assemble. Recommend putting the box near the place where the treadmill will be located. If you open the box the right way, you can slide the components over and assemble in place. Easy to use and keep me active even when the weather does not allow me to take a walk around town.
"I ran into the same issue that lots of others have encountered with trying to reset the machine after applying lubricant; I read the manual up & down! I tried all kinds of variations based on the manual for resetting! BUT -- I got it to reset, woo hoo! I turned the machine off & unplugged it; then, plugged it back in & turned it on; next, I pressed & held the up arrow and then pressed the Stop button -- reset! It was amazing, ha!!! I had tried contacting Customer Service & was told, ""refer to page 16"" -- which I practically have memorized, ugh. I found a Youtube video on resetting the lube indicator & it said that generally, treadmills can be reset when pressing stop & then up; I tried it twice, no luck. So, that's when I went through the above (hold the up button & then press Stop) -- and it worked. My treadmill is about as lubed as a greased pig right now, but at least it doesn't say ""LUbE"" anymore! :-D
Otherwise -- I like the machine. It's basic -- though now I wish that it did have the mileage to the hundredths, but oh well. I stop it immediately when I see it hit the next tenth. I'll live! I don't have much recent experience with a treadmill, but -- it does what I wanted it to do & I get in a nice sweaty run! I like the little ledge so I can set my phone to be able to watch Netflix. It was easy enough to put together but does require 2 people as parts are heavy."
"If this was a $1200 treadmill, it would get a 2 star review. But it isn't. It is a $400 treadmill and it is much better than you would have any reason to expect from a budget treadmill. It was a breeze to assemble. The first time I walked on it, I was shocked at how quiet it ran. Now, I'm old and don't run so it is likely louder when you do. I expect you will find it too short and too narrow for serious running anyway.
The only two flaws, and i consider them unforgivable:
1. There is no light in the display! WTH? That couldn't possibly be more than a $2 cost.
2. It has NO drink holder! There are a couple pockets that could perhaps hold a pack of cigarettes if you like to smoke while you exercise, but forget about a water bottle.
It does, however, have a nice little rack to place your tablet, but it will block your view of the built-in display."
I was so excited to get this treadmill because it was just what I was looking for to do my daily walks during the cold winter month in Wisconsin, where I live. The price was right and it did not have all these fancy "bells and whistles"!. It arrived within a few days of ordering and the assembly was not bad at all. I started my walks and all was good, and then a couple of month in the back elevation pin broke which I guess was no big deal since the elevation is like one inch and really does not have an impact on my work out or the functioning of the machine. Forward a few month and the grounding pin from the plug in stayed stuck in my outlet and again the treadmill still works and did not have an impact on my workouts. Today, however (exactly the day one year ago when I ordered the machine) I started my machine and did my warm up walk ,about 5 min, and it came to an abrupt halt and displayed a message of E6. When I looked up the code in the manual it said something about "Controller malfunction". As I proceeded to read further it talked about the warranty and that I was supposed to have send in a Warranty card that I received, which I did not receive and of course the company Xterra will not honor issues unless you send in the card, and of course my year was up today. Go figure! I am very up set that my 349 dollar purchase lasted only exactly one year! Very disappointing and I am pretty sure that I would have been better off buying someone used machine for less money!
This is a great entry level treadmill. It doesn't have a ton of bells and whistles but more than I need. I love tracking my calories burned as well as my distance. I have used the heart BPM reader a couple of times, it worked well. What mattered to me was that it could hold up to my size (Male, 6'2 205) it says limit of 200 but holds up well for me. My wife and I have had it for 3 months and both use it 6 days a week. I run on 7.0 most the time and have gotten it up to 8.5. It does great. I was worried about the width, it isn't super wide, but again if you are at or under my height and weight, it should be good for you. I putt it together in about 20min with no help. Easy. It folds incredibly easy as well but I just leave it down. I have been promoted to lube it once in the 3 months I've had it and it was very easy...YouTube it. Great value
This treadmill has pros and cons. The two cons in my opinion are that it is pretty noisy and there is really no incline. I agree with another reviewer who said it shouldn't be advertised as having one. The machine itself is quiet but it get really creaky and squeaky whenever someone is on it. The pros are that it is otherwise what I had been wanting. It works well, assembly was quick, it's narrow but not too narrow, and I can use it for walking and running. It gets up to a nice speed and is easy to use. I always lean toward simple is best, and I like the simplicity of this treadmill.
I walk on my treadmill EVERY day. After many years and several repairs to keep my old treadmill running, it finally died in a very dramatic puff of smoke, literally! I didn't have a lot of money to spend, so after much shopping and comparing, I chose this TR150 by XTRRA. Wasn't sure I would like it because my old machine was a very heavy duty model compared to this much lighter one, but I needn't have worried. It's a great treadmill for at home use. I'm a plus size lady and was worried about how well it would support me even though the stats said it would. It works fine. Great machine at a great price!!
"For the money, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better quality treadmill. My wife and I have been using the machine several times a week so far, and no major issues to speak of.
One problem we did run into was with the belt gradually floating to the right of the machine. I contacted Spirit Fitness's customer support, and this turned out to be an excellent experience. I spoke with Stanford via phone, and he quickly walked me through how to adjust and tighten the belt so that we would not continue to experience this issue. The whole process took only about 10 minutes from start of call to finish, and Stanford could not have been more helpful.
-----------------UPDATE 11/11/2019---------------------
So unfortunately, the treadmill ended up getting returned. The belt continued to move to the right, to the point where it was actually scraping the side of the belt guide and grinding it into black dust. No amount of belt adjustment or roller locking fixed the issue. I have owned 3 treadmills to-date, and I have never seen a problem like this with any of them.
With these issues and at the cost proposition, Spirit Fitness likely should have just issued a new unit, seeing as the warranty was still valid. However, they wanted to send a tech to the home and inspect the machine. For the money paid, I wasn't willing to jump through these hoops."
Aside from the fact that it has no cup holders at all. Which is weird. It a great treadmill for the price. Also I don't know why treadmill companies and actually home fitness equipment companies. Tend to add a tablet or phone holder, which is a great idea. But just executed poorly by almost all of them. WHY? Would you make the tablet holder cover the screen. It should always be just above the built in screen so that you can watch what ever it is we want while exercising. But no, companies actually agree on in development on putting it just under the screen so the tablet or phone blocks their own built in screen. Those that really make sense. I mean who in the company okay'd this for production. But anyway....aside from that I would recommend it and to get your own universal mount to attach to the treadmill so you can place your device up and out of the way.
I was hesitant to buy this because I knew it was smaller than a typical gym treadmill. I'm 6'3" 210 lbs and was afraid I would be too big for it. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this. I have used this treadmill everyday for about a month and it's plenty sturdy, I can walk and run on it without any problems. For the price, this is a solid quality treadmill and I definitely recommend it for someone in the market for an economical unit. Only took about 5 minutes to put together, comes basically assembled.
"After getting the LUBE message on my TR150 and not noticing the sticker on the console that said to hold down Enter. After digging around on the internet and finding various manuals with various different methods to try to reset the code, I accidentally got into a programming menu and set the treadmill to kilometers instead of miles and could not reset it.
I called customer service and talked to Devonnia who was very helpful. We tried a couple of things to reset the treadmill, but were unable to do so. She then helped me get the treadmill registered and is sending me a new console as a replacement, along with instructions on how to get it set up properly.
As for as the treadmill itself, it is very affordable and a good deal for the price. It doesn't have power incline or other advanced features, but it works as a basic walking/jogging machine. Assembly and maintenance is easy and other than the console settings, I have not had a problem with it."
"Let me preface this review by saying that I will try to keep it as straightforward as I can, as I am sure that others are currently looking at this treadmill as a potential option, so I don't want to waste their (your) time. I'll also try to describe my experience as dispassionately as possible and just stick to the facts. That being said, here goes ...
I purchased this treadmill in hopes that it would enable me to run/jog/walk within the comfort of my own home. In no way am I against doing any of that outside, I just felt that a treadmill would be more convenient, especially during the winter months. So, after doing a good deal of research, I landed on this particular product. I read through review after review (much like what you are doing right now), hoping that my reservations would be assuaged. Frankly, I was anxious about potentially buying a $300-$350 treadmill and expecting it to be reliable. As is the case with many things (but not everything) in life, generally the pricier the item, the better quality it is.
Aside from some negative reviews here and there, the majority of people who bought this product seemed quite pleased; in fact, I'm sure the current score distribution still reflects that. Of the negative ones, however, a common complaint was that the user was getting error messages and the treadmill wouldn't operate as a consequence. Admittedly, I thought (like many other consumers do) to myself, ""Nah, that was THAT person's experience. It won't be mine."" So, I took a chance and bought it ...
Today marks the fourth day after this treadmill arrived at my house. It lasted that long before giving up the ghost. Unlike other unfortunate users (who more than likely had it worse), this treadmill did not provide me with any clues as to what the problem might be. The owner's manual contains a page dedicated to error codes and corresponding diagnostics, but unfortunately, this became useless in my own case, as my treadmill didn't display any codes - the belt simply gave out. I used all of the old tried-and-true solutions (e.g. unplugging, then plugging its power cord back in; hitting the reset button; checking the power outlets in my home; inspecting the belt; etc.) before calling the support line. No offense to the person whom I spoke to, but he was clearly just following a list of instructions in a manual, regurgitating possible remedies that I had already tried many, many times. After 30 minutes on the phone, I resigned myself to the fact that it just wasn't going to work out (no pun intended). I had/have become one of those statistics (i.e. one-star experiences).
""What did you expect? You bought a $300 treadmill ..."" is a statement that I can already hear someone saying, which honestly, is very valid. But, at the risk of sounding redundant, I was in the market for a relatively inexpensive, yet reliable treadmill. I thought that this one would do the job and it did! ... but only for a few days.
I believe this product comes with a warranty, so I apologize if my headline was misleading. I say, ""Caveat emptor,"" rather in the sense that you, the potential buyer, beware. Loads of people have purchased this treadmill and it has gone favorably for them, and quite frankly, I'm happy for these folks; moreover, if you do indeed go ahead and buy it, I hope that it goes favorably for you as well. Yet, just know that there is always the possibility that it won't. At any rate, please don't approach the situation with the same folly that I had: ""It won't happen to me.""
I hate having to write this review, because I really, really wanted to be a fan of this treadmill; in fact, after its maiden voyage (that is, the first run on it), I couldn't have been happier. Assembly took all of twenty minutes (which you can probably do quicker with another person present); the treadmill is easy to fold, affording you some more space in a room if you need it; and its operations are pretty self-explanatory. I know that some users have complained about the inaccuracy of the treadmill's calculation of distance, and while that may be true, I didn't find it to be egregious - certainly not enough to keep me from using it. Admittedly, the incline feature was/is rather useless, so I didn't pay any attention to it. What I did like about this treadmill, though - at least, while it lasted - was the ability to change speed (treadmill's range is 0-10 mph) quickly. This was especially convenient, as I was using it for HIIT. I am ultimately giving this treadmill one star, however, because it didn't go the distance (another pun). I am having to return it and instead of taking THAT chance of getting an operable replacement, I'm opting for a refund. (Getting it back into its original box - which I'm glad I kept stored away - was no small task in itself, and is something that I wouldn't want to have to go through again.)
Last pun: Beware of this average run-of-the-treadmill product!"
I was worried this would be hard to assemble, but it truly wasn't. It took me 15 minutes tops (including lubricating the belt). It works great for small spaces and it goes up to a speed of 9 which I feel is perfect. It's not too loud as to disturb people in Another room and fits in my small home office. Truly a great purchase for the price. I'll update in about 6 months after constant use - I'm 5'4 and ~150 pounds, planning to jog/walk 4-5 days a week at a speed of 4-6.
"I got this so that in the winter my wife and I don't have to go to the gym to walk or jog.
I've had an overall good experience with the TR150. I'm a pretty rudimentary user, and it's a rudimentary machine. I don't do programs or circuit training, I put on an audiobook in my headphones and I just jog. So I'm certainly not an expert on treadmills, but for me, this has been a great inexpensive entry level treadmill.
Now, I don't use it for intense, heavy running. I use it mainly for speed walking and slow jogging (3.0-4.0). This treadmill is very rudimentary in what it does and its options, which is totally fine for me. I adjust the speed on my own whenever I want to go faster or slower, I don't use the preprogrammed running stuff. But its nice that they're there anyway.
It doesn't seem like the measurement stuff works too well... like sometimes it seems like the distance isn't being measured, and I don't think the heart rate for your hand grip is too accurate.
It was fairly easy to put together; it was mostly pre-assembled, you just have to connect a few main parts together. It also came with lubricant for the belt, which is something I'd been concerned about while shopping for treadmills. It does come pre-lubricated though.
The beeping noise is kind of loud and annoying, it beeps every time you turn it on and once per unit of increase or decrease when you change speeds... it kinda scares my dogs. I almost want to try to just snip the wire to the speaker since you can't turn it off.
The fold-up mechanism is easy to use, but isn't very heavy duty or secure. If you have young kids around or pets, I would highly recommend leaving it down permanently. Earlier today my wife and I were trying to move the treadmill while it was folded up, taking care to remember that it's not a super study latch, we were holding it up and it still unlatched a few times and almost nailed me in the face.
After all that you might wonder why I rated this so well. I rated it based on the price; what my expectations were and my personal needs. It met my expectations, and it does what it's supposed to."
We've had this treadmill for a few months. Overall, we've been pleased with it. For the cost, it is very sturdy and runs well. It was easy to assemble and the controls are easy to use. The only issues I would note are the walking/running surface is very hard. While getting some amount of heel pain isn't unheard of for me when exercising, usually it hits when doing higher intensity workouts, but I've noticed on this treadmill I encounter those pains even when doing a walk. Might just be me, but seems like a hard surface. Other complaint is that the belt can move from side to side gradually during a workout. If I favor a foot or am watching TV while I workout (for which I have to look sightly left) the general favoring of that side will cause the belt to move over until it, eventually, is running against the plastic on the side of the running surface. This creates an annoying noise, but if I consciously just over favor the other foot for a few seconds it will end up back in the middle. Hadn't had this happen on a treadmill before but had really only used ones at gym, previously. Also don't like the plastic pieces that overlay the very back edges of the walking surface as the back of my shoe sometimes comes in contact with them. Overall, though, really like the treadmill and would recommend. I was paying about as much per year to join a local community center as I did for this device; for the price it's a very functional treadmill that hasn't really given us any issues thus far after several months of use.
"I am very impressed with this Xterra Treadmill. It is very affordable but I don't feel like I've had to compromise on quality in any way. It's a basic model that provides a very sturdy walking/running surface with solid supports to hold onto if necessary. I am on the upper end of the weight limit but it supports me just fine and offers a very stable experience.
The assembly was easy and fast. The treadmill/motor assembly is pretty heavy and if you have to move it a significant distance I would suggest it's a job for two. I assembled it by myself and it was easy to slide and lift one side and then the other to get it into place. The other parts of assembly consisting of installing the two side supports and then the control panel was very easy to do- twelve screws with washers I think and two connectors. Simple and straight forward. When folded up it takes up about a 2 1/2 foot square, maybe a little smaller. I'm not a small man but it's plenty long and the surface is wide enough to be very comfortable when in use. I am very happy with the construction as it's well made.
The Xterra is pretty quiet when in use and has just enough control features to give me some variety in exercise without being complicated to use. It doesn't look or feel cheaply made in any way and offers a very stable platform to exercise on. I am very happy with my purchase."
"Bought this last March when they closed the gym. After nine months of using it every other day for half an hour, it's still working great. It was easy to set up myself, and I'm 50 and 5'2 with no almost no upper-body strength or assembly skills. Maintenance is really easy”it just has the basic program functions, which is another reason I chose it. All I have to do is lube the belt every few weeks, tweak it with an Allen wrench so it stays straight, and hand vac any pet fur out of its innards once a week.
It's small and narrow, which is perfect for me in my small apartment, but might not be ideal for someone taller. Not wobbly or too noisy, and the downstairs neighbors have only asked once if I could not use it during their zoom interview. Very happy with the purchase!"
I cannot operate this in my house because it keeps tripping off the circuit breakers. Its marked as 9A but it cannot even be on a 20A dedicated circuit. I don't know what joke 2000+ people who gave glowing reviews are on about....this is a fake unusable item for a regular household.
I am 64 female I put it together by myself was so easy!!! Put my iPad on it went to YouTube where they have virtual walking trails and took off! Love it. What a buy!
"Straight to the point review:
--My family wanted something to walk/jog on during the colder months. We have a TV and speaker in our basement already, so didn't want or need any of the bells and whistles associated with higher priced options. There is a nice little lip-shelf for a phone or tablet.
--I was able to assemble this by myself in about 15 minutes. Other than getting it out of the box, you don't need a second person. The treadmill base is all one piece. All you have to do is plug into two wires, attach the poles, and then the control unit slides right on top. Everything fits together easily and there are about 12 screws total holding it together.
Once it is together, it isn't that heavy/hard to move around even if you're only slightly in shape. I do imagine lifting the base to be stored upright might be hard for some though.
--Once assembled, this particular unit has small footprint for a treadmill, especially if you're used to using ones at a gym. Of particular note is the treadmill band itself. The running/walking just ok but the width is skinny/narrow.
I am 6ft 2, 180 pounds. While taller than most, my width is about average. I have used this three times now. The width is not a huge issue for me (as long as I am paying attention to my stride) but could be if I was tired. My wife and daughter--both petite--don't have any issues at all. If you're a wider person, or if you have a really long running gait, I would say to look elsewhere.
--speaking of looking elsewhere, this is NOT built for serious runners/sprinters. It definitely strains at higher speeds and you definitely feel the impact of your plant foot at those speeds. The best use, which it does just dandy with, is a healthy, faster paced walk/light jog. It's not whisper quiet at faced-pace walk, but it is fine.
--The build quality seems ok but I don't think this is going to last years upon years. It definitely has that ""made in China"" kind of cheap feel to it--and the control computer/buttons seem like they are right out of 1987. BUT, you're meant to walk on it, not show it off.
I am glad I bought the extended warranty for 25 bucks. Having now built and used it, seems like a really good investment.
--the packaging was EXCELLENT. Even though there was a gash in the box from one of the bands, everything is secured with fitted Styrofoam. The guys who delivered it were nice enough to bring it to the back of my house and my son and I slid it down the basement stairs.
Would I buy/recommend. As long as you manage your expectations and are not training for a marathon, I think YES. We got it when it dropped to $310, which seems about right."
"I just got this treadmill so I have only used it a couple times. I am a heavy set, 5'6"" woman and appreciate that it's sturdy. I jogged at a 5 (speed) with no issues. This treadmill is great for the price!
Negatives: The handlebars placement -they are at the same height as my hands so I have punched them a few times. The belt is a little narrow and loose, however I think it will flatten with use. There is not place for a water bottle."
Arrived on time. Very simple to set up. I purchased this for mostly walking. So far it's wonderful!!!! I'm so happy I read reviews and decided to go with this one. I don't know how accurate the pulse reader is, but it stayed consistent. Everything seemed to work correctly. I'm very happy to have a great treadmill for the cold season ahead!!
"This treadmill seems to be a high quality, fitness center worthy piece of equipment. My wife has used it every day since we set it up a month ago with no problems/mechanical issues. Very straight forward and simple assembly with an included Allen wrench. Note: This item is heavy and ships at around 110 pounds. Get some help to get the box from the drop point and into your house to your setup location. We are in our 70's and it was a REAL struggle for us going it alone. Note: Do buy the protective mat to protect your flooring or carpet.
The unit has variable speeds from slow walk to run and has a speed governor that gradually starts and stops the treadbelt. Incline degrees can be changed manually and there are 10(?) preprogrammed workouts. The motor is extremely quiet and does not interfere with anyone reading or watching TV."
During this pandemic, I have stopped going to gym. Due to cold winter, its not possible to go out for walk/jogging. So I was researching to use something inside the house and came across this product which #1 seller on Amazon. I have been using for few weeks now, I am really happy with my purchase. All the family members inside my house are using it as per their convenient time and everybody is very happy. It was about 15mins assembly, with very clear instructions. Awesome product!
"I knew when I bought this that it is not a high end treadmill. I thought I had realistic expectations. It went together pretty easy and worked fine at first. I was happy.
Then about a month after I first got it, the display screen started acting up, it would go black in areas that should not be black, making it hard to read. And it kept getting worse. Sometimes the display would be fine, other times it would be impossible to read. It is now much worse than the attached picture shows.
I submitted a warranty claim online, and was contacted via email asking for more information which I supplied the same day. I didn't hear anything back for a while.
Eventually, I got a voicemail from them talking about me buying that part since I am out of warranty. Well yes I am past 90 days now but that's just because they are so slow to respond. I was well within the 90 days when I first reported the problem to them.
I returned their call, just getting the voicemail of the person who contacted me before. I left a message for him explaining the situation, no response back for a week and a half.
I have tried calling the main support number a few times now, but you have to wait on hold forever. I had to hang up after half an hour last time to do something else.
The last time I tried calling them I waited on hold for an hour. After an hour, the system told me to leave a message and they would call me back. Only instead of actually being able to leave a message, it hung up on me. So frustrating!
All I want is for them to send me a new screen.
It does still work, just hard to read the screen.
I'll update this later if I ever get anywhere on the warranty support.
I would be cautious about buying from this company. They don't seem to stand behind their products or offer a very good support experience."
"I've been using this treadmill every other day for about 6 months. Overall, for the money, this has been exactly what I wanted. It's easy to use, has worked well overall and is very functional.
I had an issue shortly after purchase where the screen totally went black. I simply called the company and they replaced the upper portion at no cost (it was under warranty). They sent the new section with a return label for the old one and I was back in business.
I have noticed a bit of a squeak at around 8 MPH, but it's not all the time or that often.
My sister has the same model and I used it while staying at her place on a visit and it worked great. They've had their > 1 year now.
*REMEMBER - this one doesn't have a mechanical incline. You can change the incline but it's a manual process that cannot be done while using the treadmill."
It was easy to put together and the box it shipped in slid pretty easily. Took about 40 minutes to put together, but when I turned it on it threw an E2 error. I ended up taking it apart and found one of the connections on the circuit wasn't attached and the motor locked up. Spent maybe an hour with that and lubed the tread again. After that it worked perfectly. I've used it 17.5 hours with no issue. If you aren't sure if you would want to fix it yourself I would recommend getting the protection plan.
I had mixed reviews about this treadmill but overall great value. I am a 33 year-old female, approximately 115 pounds and I primarily bought this to help do LISS at home as part of the BBG/Sweat programs. So I typically do a brisk walk - never run at a higher speed although I don't think that would be an issue. It worked great until about 10 months into it I got a "LUBE" sign and no matter how many times I followed the reset steps it never went away. The treadmill still worked but you couldn't track time etc bc of the error message. I called the customer service line and their reset steps didn't work either but the young guy (SORRY I FORGOT YOUR NAME AND I HOPE YOU STILL GET CREDIT!) sent me a new console (the display part) even though my treadmill was out of warranty for free. The treadmill is working great again so far and the error has been fixed. I definitely recommend this for anyone who needs a quick fix at home and wants something affordable.
We bought this so we can continue daily walking when the weather is bad and we can't do mall walking during a pandemic. This is a solid machine without fancy features. We have put 100 miles or so on it, and it is still running fine. It starts gently after a short countdown, and has a wide range of speeds to choose from. The pulse sensor works well, and the speed display seems pretty accurate. It also displays the length in time of the workout. I have found that if I set the speed to 3 mph, it takes about 22 minutes by the clock to reach a mile on the display, so the speed display is a little off, but not by much. The machine is quiet and reasonably compact. We have not tried the fold and move feature, and we have not tried running on it.
"Pro
1 Easy to assemble .
2 Easy to operate
3 Fairly easy to maintain.
4 Powerful and makes very little noise.
5 Requires very little footprint and hence requires small space to set it up and run.
6 I and my wife use it daily for a total of 1 hour walking only , so far no problem or issues.
Con
1 It requires 2 persons to move it , install it and maintain it. It is not as light as we thought when we folded it for cleaning.
2 Belt sheds a lot during the first week, now not as much.
3 Hood cover removal is not easy for vacuuming the head.
4 Requires regular maintenance every month to ensure good performance. I have done 1 maintenance routine so far and it takes me more than 1 hour. Regular oiling required."
Arrived quickly, assembled quickly and easily, doesn't work. No error signs or anything, simply does not turn on. I'll update if anything changes, but as of now it is absolute garbage and a waste of money.
"Arrived in one box and had it put together with about 10 screws and 30 mins of my time. The belt is not very wide at just 16 inches but it works well enough. The handles are nice and sturdy but I noticed that the upper handles were SLIGHTLY out of alignment with the belt deck. Not a huge deal but slightly annoying.
The treadmill belt works well. No slipping and very sturdy.
The unit is very quiet overall. I like that it has a ledge below the numbers for a tablet or phone to keep me entertained while walking to nowhere :).
The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars are the narrow belt and upper deck that is slightly out of alignment but it's usable and couldn't beat it for the money."
After becoming an empty nester I decided to sell my large house and downsize dramatically to a small bungalow. I did not have space for my wonderful large treadmill and had to give it up. After moving I decided I missed having a treadmill and decided to get a downsized one to fit my house. I am so pleased with this treadmill!! It is stable, quiet, easy to assemble. I am a 59 year old woman, I had it from box to using in in less than 30 minutes. Tip: instead of lifting the heavy treadmill out of the box, remove the box from around the treadmill. It folds easily, has a ledge that secures my iPad so I can easily watch tv. I have had to do no belt adjustments. I was concerned about the width and length of the smaller belt but I have had no problems and I'm 5'8 tall. I highly recommend this treadmill for anyone with space issues or just does not to spend a fortune on one with a lot of bells and whistles they don't need.
"got it yesterday and I am still speechless! This is nothing that I have expected¦ But this price I was thinking it's gonna be a little flimsy thing that will do a little bit of exercise.
This treadmill is solid, with all the bells and whistle˜s that I did not expect at all! It is quiet and runs very smoothly. Very easy to change speed and it has a safety key. I am definitely in love with it. If something unexpected happens I will definitely update."
Im 71 and believe i cud have done it all by myself. Paid 2 delivery guys a tip to carry it to my dining room. I watched a youtube video on assembly. Written Instructions were good. My son happened to come and insisted on assembly. He cudnt believe how easy/fast, like 15 minutes unpack amd insert screws/washers. Started right up (have to insert red safety to remove E0 code and start). Son (a jogger) and i (a walker) tested: perfect. I did 2 days research (under $1000, mostly assembled) before choosing this one, $350. I will be using 2x day. Right now i only start and up-arrow speed, it shows time. If encounter any issue, will update this. I bought yoga mat qtr inch thick to protect my hardwood floor.
Ordered this treadmill for Christmas 2019. We used it about 3x per week until October 2020 when it started to just completely seize up and abruptly stop mid run. Not only was this frustrating but also dangerous. We took perfect care of the machine, used belt lubricant monthly per the instructions, always made sure our shoes were free of debris etc. We decided to call the company to see what we could do. They told us that we would need to purchase a new motor for about $100 and also a new belt for about $200!!! This costs more than what we paid for this machine in the first place. Save yourself the time and frustration and spring for a better quality machine.
My wife wanted to get a treadmill to use in our basement cave during the colder months of the year. Her only request was that the treadmill could fold for storage when we have guests over. After researching several options, we settled on this. I was immediately impressed by the quality of the packaging: all parts were well secured and protected by Styrofoam inserts and the carton arrived unscathed with no tears or dents. Great attention to detail as the folding mechanism was secured by a strap to ensure inadvertent unfolding while assembling. Assembly was easy although you probably do want a second person to move the main component. Pretty much four parts to assemble plus a wire harness. Good quality fasteners and easy to follow instructions. Treadmill started and has been running flawlessly for several weeks. I like the assembly and my wife likes this treadmill's performance.
Very happy we bought this. It has been so helpful. It was larger than expected, but it unfolds and folds very easily (although it is a little heavy). It makes some sound, but it's manageable when walking. It's louder when running. We love it and it has made everyone in the family more active. So worth it!
"I like this treadmill. I bought it so I could get some exercise while quarantined. I'm not a runner, I just like to plod along on it while I'm on phone calls or watching TV so I move my body a little bit and it's good for that. It fits nicely in an apartment and was easy to put together by myself (I'm a 5'2"" woman and the hardest part was getting the body of the treadmill out of the box - it weighs about 100lbs so I just tipped the box and slid it out, but you'll definitely want the delivery person to get that box into your house for you). It only required like 10 bolts (included, as was an allen wrench) and came with lubricant for the belt. I put it on a thin mat and it's quiet; my downstairs neighbor hasn't complained at all.
It is easy to fold, but really hard to move around - the wheels are toward the back, so you kind of have to get under it and tip it toward you like a wheelbarrow, which doesn't feel very safe and is very hard to maneuver. I thought I'd be able to fold it up and put it against the wall when I'm not using it, but I definitely can't. So it just lives in my living room all the time. If I absolutely have to I can move it by myself, but it's not easy. If it were easier to move around I'd give it 5 stars."
Looks great but very cheap. The alignment has never been right from the day I bought it. I wish I could return it. I am only 120 pounds and it makes so much noise .
I ordered the Xterra 150 November 18, 2020 and it arrived December 1, 2020. I ordered it for my 60+ year old mom (and myself) so that we can share it during the pandemic. Very nice treadmill and super easy to use! I like that it's pretty self explanatory and has the speed settings for a quick startup. The main thing that disappointed me was to find that it arrived cracked due to shipping mishandling! For $400 I was hoping that it would have arrived in perfect condition. I've set it up and wish I could have the broken piece close to the tred and the crack on the power button could be brand spanking new! I'm keeping it because it's a nice workout machine... it's just unfortunate that it arrived damaged.
"For the price this is a good treadmill. It arrived promptly and the box was only slightly damaged, the product was just fine. I have had it about 18 months now and it still works just fine.
Pros:
Light enough for me to carry to the basement on my own ~165lb female
Sturdy enough that it doesn't move very much while running
Fairly quiet - I can have my audio book on with the volume at normal level
Cons:
Completely inaccurate mileage counter - while yes it takes the belt time to speed up, I've timed it while it was already at pace. 6mph should be 0.1mile every minute, this typically takes 1min 5-15 seconds - not even consistently off.
It is narrow and I hit my knuckles on the handlebars.
It does not fold up as small as I would have liked.
However - if you are just running for the exercise this is a great product. I haven't quite been able to figure out if the speed is off or if the measurement of mileage is off, my Samsung Galaxy watch is never very accurate indoors.
Overall, for the price these are not terrible complaints. I have a small space to use this, so it fits the bill. For those who are not time training this treadmill is just fine."
The Product was good to use for the first 60 days, even though the material looked very cheap ,afterwards it completely started falling apart. Started to make a small noise around the 45 day mark not an issue at first but after two months of usage it definitely shows how cheap it truly is. They only give you 90 day warranty, after I called for help turns out it was a BAD bearing! And they ask me to pay for it costing $100. Since it was out of warranty range. If I known it was only going to last 90 days I would have bought a better bran Forsure! At that rate save your money and invest in a better brand and treadmill especially if you are looking for quality
"I am very satisfied with the product. However, If anyone gets the lube message please do the following:
After applying the lube underneath the belt, Press the ENTER button for three seconds to reset.
I am giving 4 stars and not 5 because the Manuel I retrieved online says to press PROGRAM button for 3 seconds to reset which is incorrect. I had to look through the reviews made by other customers to get the right answer.
Besides this minor setback, it is worth the money and a great purchase especially during these COVID times. Stay safe y'all."
I love this treadmill! I walk five times a week or more, and this treadmill has been a lifesaver this winter. I don't have to worry about the weather, or what time of day to walk. It was easy to put together, it folds up when not in use, and it's not noisy. I can watch TV or listen to music. It does everything I need it to do. It's also very easy to operate, it shows how much distance I walk, time and speed. I put my fitbit on my ankle when I walk , so I can keep track of my exercise, then if I don't swing my arms, and or hang on to the treadmill, my fitbit still does recognize that I walked.
I can't lie this is not a good treadmill. It had good reviews and i tried to save money during quarantine so I purchased it but I wish I didn't. I even tried to return it and Amazon said they would send someone to get it and they never came now I'm stuck with it. It doesn't calculate the correct distance at all I don't understand why, and it only calculates 0.1's and not 0.01's which is disappointing. Whenever I raised the speed past 7 mph the belt jerks and I nearly break my leg. If you accidentally step on the side between the belt and cover while running it also jerks. I'm going to try to lubricate it and tighten the belt and see what happens but honestly listen to me if you can spend a few more dollars and get a higher quality treadmill please do you will not regret it.
It's been less than a month and the screen is already malfunctioning. And a product this large is such a hassle to return or exchange. Ughhh.
"First, set up/install. Out of the box, it's quite easy to assemble and I did it myself. It is quite heavy but I'm accustomed to moving things on my own. I took all of the parts out of the box in my garage and moved them individually into my workout room. I put it together once inside. Easy to follow instructions with no issues.
Second, ease of use. It's a plug and play treadmill. Not a lot of bells and whistles but it's definitely a bang for your buck type of machine. I have had it about a week and a half and I run about 2.5 miles daily. I'm 5' and about 165. As for quiet, honestly, I don't care if it's loud so long as I can hear my tablet while I'm running. I have not attempted to move it since I placed it where I need it to be. It's easy to fold up to vacuum underneath.
Third, work out programs. I don't know if I'll actually use these. It would be great if the manufacturer shared what they actually were instead of the graphs on the machine. I tried one and it went to a speed of 7 from 3 and I almost lost my $&@/. So user beware. I have been manually adjusting my speeds, which is what I would do at the gym anyway.
Four, users. It's just me in my home so I'm the only one using it about 6 times a week. It's definitely been great to be able to run inside, away from the central Texas humidity and currently the Saharan Dust in the region.
I'll update my review in six months or so but for now, I'm quite happy with my purchase. It's basic, easy to set up, easy to use, and meets my needs."
"I haven't had this treadmill for very long. For the price it's a decent treadmill. I noticed others offered only a 46 inch track and this one is 50 inches. I couldn't imagine a short running area. I'm not that tall, 5'11"" but if you're taller this might a challenge at higher speeds. My kids watched me run on it and said my feet get pretty close to the back edge, so I definitely use the full 50 inches.
My biggest complaint is the entire upper part shakes around when running. I can't really set my phone on the display area because it'll bang around when running. I found that if I lay a damp, nearly dry, hand towel down then it works great as a cushion between the treadmill and my phone so it doesn't bang around a lot.
I don't really use the pre-programmed settings. I like to do a light warmup on #3 for about 5 minutes. Then I'll pause and stretch. Then a light jog on #5 or #6 speed for about 10 minutes, then a cooldown for another 5 minutes at #3 or #2.5 I'll also throw in a moderate run at #9 for a minute or 2. #9 is the fastest speed. I feel it's a very good speed. I don't think I'd be comfortable if it went any faster than that.
It's not that small, even when folded up. It measures 60"" (5ft) tall, 29"" wide and 29"" long in the folded position. Unfolded it's about 60"" long"
Do your self a favor do not waste your money this XTERRA Fitness TR150 Folding Treadmill Black just stop working it pop a message E6 and does nor work at all i have it for 5 months amazon can do nothing they told me to contact the manufacturer i did it and they just keep avoiding a solution for me . so is a waste of time and money I wonder when companies will do the right thing and provide you with a decent machine at least that work for 1 year is that asking too much? is a shame have this companies selling garbage. i am writing this to help as many people i can is the only thing i can do as a consumer this time i lost money and time i hope you don't
I absolutely hate treadmills and prefer to run outside. I bought this in March after the pandemic started to close things because with the kids home and the uncertainty I wanted to make sure I could consistently run for my sanity. It's easy to assemble and great for walking but if you get your run faster than a 7 it gets a little shaky. I would not recommend this model for runners wanting speed work or super long workouts but for an easy paced 3-5 miles it gets the job done without breaking the bank.
I bought Xttera, since my office gym also uses same machines. despite I maintained it carefully, it started giving problems just in one year of use. Brlt does not run immediately, I need push it manually to start. With 3 months, I started noticing motor got hot with in 15 min. of use. I lubricant it every month as per instructions. Very disappointed with product.
there is no way all this was , was 108 lbs, it was much heavier. Wasn't happy where UPS dropped it off at either, anyway I had problems with 3 screws , I had to fight them for awhile before they finally went in. the connection of the computer to the base was a little tough too. the male part (in the base) was way down inside, after a bit it I finally got it connected. Everything else was easy enough, but I did do it by myself even though I have a stabilizing bar in my back that was put in 4 months ago. but when you have no one to help it is what it is... I want to lose 30 to 35 more pounds, I've already lost 25. this will help. it is really cold in the mornings, so cold (yes we get cold in Texas) with all the metal in me it's painful, hence the treadmill. I won't need to fold it up, no need to try, no reason to. so we shall see. I'm 5' 10" tall I have long legs so it was the longest tread I could find. and it is perfect on that end. the scopes were good too. I did a lot of research too. but I still did though get the 2 year warranty. I may be Irish but I have NO luck... better safe than sorry....
I bought this item. Mainly because of this pandemic so I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a treadmill but I wish I did. It's really affective at fast walking speeds but anything more than 4.2 mph it seems like it gets caught. I weight 145. My friends who weights 200, can't go over 3.5 before it's starts doing the same thing. If you're looking for a light weight and easy set up for fast walking pace it's perfect but anything for running, I wouldn't recommend.
I have rarely bought anything on line where I was so displeased and disappointed. For a start the box was soaked when it arrived so moving it into the house was a challenge. Not sure how it got so wet and cardboard soggy. We got it set up and the first issue was that the bolts would not go into many of the holes. Now we are both experienced with tools so upon inspection we saw that some of the holes had not been tapped correctly and had bits of metal round the edges. Fortunately we have a tap and die set, so managed to ream out the holes correctly to be able to insert the bolts. Got everything connected and tried to turn it on. NOTHING! Dead! Threw an error code and not even a twitch from the motor. Called the company. The guy did not seem surprised as I did not get any kind of apology. He took name and address and said, "I'll send you some replacement parts"!!!! Really? We are supposed to do repairs on a new item? At this point I would like to return this but not sure how I can. The box is a soggy heap in the front yard and it is way too heavy for us to transport. Not sure what to do next!!
"Easy to use and build. User friendly. It has been dependable for a casual run at a moderate speed. Everyone who has used it is 165lbs and below, and all feel it is stable to run on for an extended amount of time. Amazing price for its quality.
SPEED & BELT: I bought it because, at the time, no other treadmill, for this price, could go up to 10 in speed. The only true downside I can find is that when my speed hits 9.2, I get that slight slipping feeling from the belt. Unsure how to fix that.. not too confident going beyond 9 for too long.
Other than that, a great casual addition to you home gym if you are looking to go 8 max speed which is already a solid jog/running speed."
"This treadmill does the job for me. Everything works. Relatively easy to assemble by one person. I lubed the treadmill prior to use. I placed a 1/4"" plywood board underneath, which sits on carpet. Solid and quiet.
I am 5'10"", 180. This equipment works well for me, but if you a big person you may want to look elsewhere, and get something with a wider tread and longer platform.
You can easily lift the platform, lock into position, and move it around. It will take up space, of course.
I had this delivered into the desired room for $20. I recommend this if you will be placing it in a room on an upper level. The box is heavy and large. The box was in perfect shape, which was a relief.
I have had it for 2 weeks, and use it every day for 45 minutes. so far, so good."
I purchased this for my home gym just to add some cardio to my weight lifting routine. I am 220lbs, this states max weight of 250lbs. Every time I step, the belt stop and starts again. WEIGHT CAPACITY IS 200 LBS!
"Had to update this. The bottom of the treadmill cover cracked. It's a cheap plastic. I emailed the company and simply got an auto response saying they'll get back to me in the order my email was received. All the packaging was cracked in shipment and I suspect that's when this happened. It's a decent treadmill for the cost. I am using it for walking. For reference I am 5'10 and 185 pounds. This replaces a Proform higher end treadmill. The only issue with this one is the speed is way off along with the calories burned counter. I walked the same distance and speed as the other treadmill and this one told me I burned 200 more calories. So the counter is way off compared to a more expensive option, as is the speed. It's probably down to a cheaper motor.
Update:
Have waited THREE weeks for customer service. I sent them photos, plus the Amazon invoice, PLUS pictures of the cracked part, PLUS the serial number as they asked. No response. Nothing. AWFUL customer service."
"Hi all,
I purchased this product a few months back but I had no space in my apartment as we were practising social distancing due to Covid-19 situation. I installed it today and it is easy to install and lightweight. It also occupies a small space. the problem is it may only work for people with weight less than 150 pounds and at running speeds less than 4.5 miles. Above 4.5 miles speed for someone with 175 to 195 pounds weight, this product is kind of useless. I am disappointed that I spent $375 but the equipment is of no use to me. My brother is also close to 180 pounds and he also faces the same problem. We do not have kids less than 140 pounds to run on this equipment. This equipment is a dud / useless for my family. If you are not heavy and sturdy, it may work out. If someone just wants to walk, it may work. But, I can work at my home all day. I do not need a treadmill to walk. Pretty disappointed"
and then it stopped working. I called the manufacturer and was told that these treadmills are "disposable" and that fixing it would cost half the value of the treadmill. I mean, sure... it's really inexpensive, and I used it daily, but it still should have lasted more than two years. Just thought people looking to buy this treadmill should know that this was the case.
Got this treadmill to use while COVID is shutting down gyms since I knew I couldn't run in the below zero degree weather here at 0500 in the mornings! It came last week and was very easy to assemble and so far I am very pleased with how it works! I run 25-35 miles every week and typically run at a 7.5-8.0 mph pace. This treadmill goes up to 9 mph and works well for extended periods of time at the pace I usually run. I've noticed a bit of back pain since I've started using this, but I'm hoping that will resolve as my body gets used to it...? Either that - or it'll force me to stretch more ðŸ˜‚. For the value, I think it's a GREAT deal. It's exactly what I need for about a year and a half in my apartment garage until my partner and move to a larger space! ðŸ˜ I will try to remember to come back and update this once I've used it for a little while.
I love this treadmill. I wanted something to run indoors because my workout schedule is inconsistent and I feel safer inside. I am 5'4" and 125 and this suits me perfectly. It gets used at least 6 days a week and I have already run several half-marathons on it. You cannot beat this for the price! I've had it for 3 months now. We are buying another one for our summer home so I can run there too!
"Its nothing fancy but For the money its great. Only took 20 minutes to pull it in the house, unbox it and put it all together.
People say it wont hold a water bottle but it holds one fine on either side where the ""Speedprograms"" are.
Belt says its 16"" but there is a gap on either side of the belt almost an inch before its steps up to thw plastic rail part so it feels like almost an 18"" pad.
It is very quite. Heart moniters seem to work well. Only thing I disliked is display is dark and the incline is such a small adjustment that you cant even tell but the good outweighs any minor complaints.
Im 200 lbs. And 5'10... mostly walk and sometimes jog. Ill update this if I run into any issues. I also picked Xterra because seems like people that are having issues, they will take care of you and fix or warranty."
So, I purchased this treadmill in October. It was very easy to assemble, though a little heavy to handle by myself. Ended up being OK on my own. The treadmill goes to 9 mph which seems quite fast. I only got to about 6.5 mph and it got a little shaky. Decided to keep it and only walk on it, but as I continued using it I noticed the belt start to stick and it would be unsafe to use going quick speeds. I ended up returning this treadmill because I preferred to walk between 4-5 mph and that was just a little too much for the belt to take. I would NEVER purchase this treadmill if you plan on running. A safe, slow 3mph would be the max I would recommend, and it is budget friendly for such.
The treadmill arrived within one week from ordering. The unit was received in good condition, however the carton was ripped and torn in places. I found no damage to the unit even though the carton sustained a fair amount of damage. The unit is heavy, and seems quite sturdy. Assembly was easy and took about 20 minutes. Initial impressions, the unit runs very quietly, is easy to use, and seems fairly durable...time will tell about the durability. The instructions were easy to read and use, and adjustments are easy. I had to adjust the belt tracking a little, but that's easy to do. The motor seems to have sufficient power for typical use. Settings and controls are easy and intuitive. Fastening hardware, power cord, safety lanyard, and belt lubricant are supplied. So far my only negative is that he LED display is not lighted, that would be nice. Unit is fairly large, and not that easy to move once located. The tread platform will latch in a vertical position to reduce the floor space needed to store the unit. Based on initial set up and limited use, the unit is well worth the modest cost.
I got this treadmill this week. Easy to assemble Took 20-25mins max. It was a little tricky to get it out of the box due to tight packaging(which is needed for machine safety). It showed an E0 error. Then I facepalmed. I forgot the emergency stop magnetic block. (the red one). Then it worked smoothly. The space for bottle/remote/phone is minimal but workable. The treadmill is sturdy and does not wobble. I live in an apartment on the 4th floor with neighbors below and on the side. No complaints yet. It is relatively quiet. So far very happy about it. Will update the review after a few months of use
This product worked well for all of one month with very light use. Then, the track unwound itself despite frequent cleaning. I was unable to contact the manufacturer for repairs despite having a warranty. DO NOT BUY
I've had this treadmill now for 2 years. I ran into an issue were it would not reset after calling for routine lubrication. I was very frustrated and called for warranty work as I purchased an extended warranty. That extended warranty was a bust, but that is another matter. Emailed the company and called and was very surprised that their support team called me back. The issue was resolved in maybe 3 minutes! Talk about your excellent customer service! I was very pleased and will be sure to buy from this company next time I need some of their equipment!!!
This treadmill will meet most runners needs and do so on a budget. The only people who may have issues are those who are looking for speeds past 10 mph but other than that I would think everyone would be pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price. I use mine to run for 20-30 minutes 6 days a week and I love it. Beats running outside in Iowa winters.
Bought this at the beginning of coronavirus lock down assuming we'd use for two-three months. The price was so low we didn't imagine it would last much longer than that. Well - we are six months in and LOVING this product. It is small, but not a problem for us. I'm 5'3 and my husband is 5'8. We had just run the LA marathon when lockdown began, so we use it to run long. My husband probably runs 20 miles a week on it at 7 or 8 speeds and I run 10 miles at 6 or 7 speeds. Also have taken to walking on it now that summer is here and it's too hot outside. Cannot recommend enough.
Like many others I purchased a treadmill as not safe to be at a gym during the pandemic. This is a great basic treadmill. Very easy to assemble. Took maybe 20 minutes. No special tools required. Worked immediately with no issues. Very easy to fold up out of the way. Great for smaller spaces. Very pleased with my purchase. Does not have a back light on the display. Not a issue for me as I have plenty of light in my room. Registration card included with option to register on the manufacture website. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a basic treadmill.
"Soo, very happy with this product, good price and quality. However, the shipping needs some improvements. The oil exploded all over the packaging because they didn't wrap it well enough to prevent this from occurring. So now I have no oil but the belt is very well lubed! Maybe for a lifetime? ðŸ™„ a tad slippery but whatever, the thing works so far.
The only other glitch, is the message board has some odd black lines that appear to the left of the speed indicator. Maybe that got oiled too? Who knows, as long as it keeps working, I'll be very happy I purchased this! Also found a small round rubber piece that got smashed and pulled off from somewhere underneath. Couldn't find where it was supposed to fit so I left it off.
Otherwise, simple set up and use so I highly recommend this treadmill for anyone who likes to walk. Not sure it's stable enough for heavy running but it's sufficient for walkers."
"My husband and I were looking for a treadmill that was not bulky, but still study and could do the job.
The assembly was not difficult; however, when we first tried to run it, nothing happened. We kept getting an error indicating that the wiring or connections were not complete. We contacted Amazon, who in turn contacted the manufacturer. They responded in a timely way and were able to coach me through opening the motor cover and discovering that a wire had become disconnected. I plugged it in, and we were off and running (pun intended!)
The treadmill is serving us very well."
"Box came very dinged up (a long rip and a fist sized hole) and one piece (and end cap) inside was shattered. Machine was still usable so I contacted the company to see if I could get a replacement cap. Communication wasn't great (I was cc'd on an email forwarded to a person), but there was never a message to me. However, about a month after I first emailed, I had a replacement cap. I saved the box in case I'd have to ship it back, and was happy when I got the new cap (liked the machine and didn't want to have to get it back in the box!)
I use it 2-4 times a week for about 30-60 minutes each time. My older kids use it occasionally as well. Had to add lube after about 3 months. I think the calorie count in the machine is a little high, and it's not too loud. I do have to turn up my tv louder than normal.
Overall, with this crazy year, it's helped me get exercise since I cancelled my gym membership. Since it was about a years membership price, if it lasts at least a few years, I'll be happy."
Item arrived on time & in good condition . I've only had this for 1 day , but it was relatively easy to assemble & operate. Most of these machines are made overseas (Mostly China) & as such do not always have clear instructions. The instructions were clear & had plenty of pictorials to help make assembly easy. It also has just the right amount of features - 10 different programs plus a manual override mode. No Bluetooth or Heart rate monitor - I don't need a physical - I just want to walk & jog on my new treadmill.
"I'm 5'11"" and use this in my low ceiling (80"") basement. The treadmill step up height is among the lowest I've seen at 4.5"".
I've had this now for 9 mos. and use it 3 to 5 times a week for about 90 min at a time with up to 60 min of this at over 7mph (Note: I previously had an Efitment that after 6 mos. began shutting off after 45min or so at 6mph!).
I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend in terms of both price point and durability."
"UPDATE: I've ran about 25 miles on it so far. 2-3 miles each time. I find that the speed and time are accurate. The noise it normal. Like a regular treadmill. Mind you I run light footed and I'm 5'7 about 145 lbs. the only issue I have isi believe the mileage is off by .1-.2 of a mile. I've been running for 6 years and I know it doesn't take me that long to run 2 miles. It's no biggie. If it was .5 I'd complain. Other than that. This machine is perfect and I definitely recommend it. For the stability price and compactness.
TR stands for trail runner.
It compact yet roomy.
I run 3 miles a day 5 days a week.
I've only walked on it but so far it's great.
I put it together by myself in less than 30 minutes. Super easy even without reading instructions.
The power cord is long -about 3.5ft- so it reaches most outlets easily.
It comes pre lubricated so you don't have to worry about it that initially. It also comes with a bottle of lube for future use.
The programming let your know when it needs more so your never guessing.
It can go up to 10mph and 220lb weight limit. I'm 5'7 about 140lbs.
I anticipate a normal noise of a treadmill if I got it up to running speed but that's fine with me. It is semi quiet however I didn't buy this for that reason.
I wanted a treadmill like the gyms but not as big or that much money. Gym treadmills are usually 60 long and 20 wide. This one is the most compact, well made, and low priced to get that impact.
It's 50 long when the super compact others I looked at before my purchase were 40 long and 15 wide and that is not doable for my jogging. I'd fall off it if I went with the 40length.
It folds and unfolds super easy and has wheels to move it. If I had to take it apart completely that would be very easy and quick as well.
I will update this post once I've ran on it for a week or more but for now I'm more than satisfied for the quality and money spent."
"My treadmill was not even a year old and is broke E2 kept coming up called today they asked me if I lucubrate it I told them I do and they said it can be the controller and a the belt which would cost $250.
I paid $304 for it.
The warranty is only good for 90 days.
How can it burn out so fast?
Do not waste your money on this brand buy another one!
Stanford the service manger is a joke.
Would not help at all was very arrogant asked him for his mangers name would not give it."
It's a very basic treadmill, which is fine. My main complaint is that the programs are just garbage. They aren't able to change speeds, so it's all super slow. It's just useful for manual setting your own speeds.
I needed a broader treadmill, where I can get a good leg span when running. I found this one, low profile, good specs, and that long tread length and just had to give this one a try. I was no dissapointed, this one works great, and so heavy duty where it can take a flat out run, and plenty of room to do it too. I love the large display, very accurate, and large enough where I don't have to wear my glasses to see it. I really like the safety of having the remote in my hand where I can kill the power and stop it if ever needed. This in itself gives me peace of mind, and a good feeling when running on it. The motor is silent, the belt makes a slight noise when running on it, however, all treadmills do except this one has even less noise than expected. I really like the ability to tip and roll this one around, with little to no effort. And I just love the thickness of it, where it slides easily underneith my couch, where friends have a hard time believing that is my treadmill under there. No cons, this one is awesome, where I am very happy with the purchase.
I have bought this treadmill for half a month, and I run for about half an hour every day. Very practical, small footprint and simple to use. Well worth the price
I LOVE this treadmill, first I was worry about running it in my basement carpet, but turns out I have no problem with it. Doesn't even need a floor mat underneath it. It's light weight and easy to put back after I finished my work out, I don't have a huge basement area with all the gym equipment laying around, the assemble was extremely easy, took me less than 5min, well packaging with inner foam protection, it came with a remote control and also included the battery too(very thoughtful), doesn't make too much noise either, Every since COVID-19 I stopped hitting the gym and gained some weights, this will be a very good equipment add to my home gym, great value and I really appreciate it, no need to go out for walk in the cold now since I have this lovely treadmill.
First time using and burned a good amount of calories. It's not super fast but you can get a light jog going on the highest speed. Easy to assemble and compact which is perfect for my small apartment.
I needed a small treadmill that would fit between my bed and the wall while also having the power to reach a high enough speed for me to get a good workout going. As you can see in the video I posted the treadmill is just the right size and has a big just charged handle
It was so easy to extract from the box and set up! Everything was clear in the instruction booklet and batteries and tool provided. It is perfect for my small apartment. I can leave it open and easily roll or slide around the floor or close it up and prop it against the wall. The weight is manageable for this older gal. The remote turns it on after you flip the switch in the front of the running platform and it cycles through the 4 readings of speed, mileage, distance, and calories used. You can increase the speed with the remote or stop it. Setting 2 is a basic walk to start. It runs almost silently. Amazing! The mat is plenty big for my walking needs. It feels quality in every way and is just what I needed to ramp up to my 10k steps a day. I wear the google fit app to count those. Love this treadmill!
A compact and basic treadmill that works very well in limited spaces. It's quiet; my husband was sleeping in his recliner and didn't know I had used it. It has controls on the support bar, but also on a watchband, which I have never really used. I love my treadmill, haven't had any problems with the tread slipping.
"I'm not sure if it's because of my size (I am not obese but def an XL) but the belt power is a little weak and even the slightest bit of weight I put down causes the belt to stop spinning unless I am pushing slightly on the bar in front of me. It makes a pretty awful noise so you know something is wrong. I walk instead of jogging (which is this treadmills main function, walking) and I do so for 2 hours a day as I am trying to lose a lot of weight with bad knees and a bad back. The handle bar is not ergonomic, however, and my wrists always hurt after I use the machine and after two weeks it's getting to a point where I am sore right away when I get on. I have to really push through my wrist pain.
The assembly is minimal, so so easy. I was able to open the box and was walking on it within 7-8 minutes. I have also had good results so far, I just have to figure out how to give my wrists a break when in use."
This is perfect for what I needed. Small compact and can easily be stored. Quick delivery in 2 days
Over the years I kept selling and repurchasing treadmills an si finally figured out it was the space they took up that drove me crazy! This didn't fit under my sofa as I'd hoped but it leans against my wall in my bedroom under my TV and gives me the speed I need and the space saving room I wanted!
It's very convenient to use, easy to move, and it's not very noisy. It's very suitable for people like me who working from home all day so that I could walking while working. Love it!
Nice machine at this price. I like the portable holder design, you can hide and storage it easily .The machine is quite and functional , only concern is the rubber belt, you have to adjust it into a balance position that you need to read the instructions and figure it out.
I like the compact size of this treadmill
Love it!
Love it! Nice size, compact and quiet. Super easy set up!
It a really good foldible treadmill I recommend
Good producto ðŸ‘Œ
"I bought this item on Amazon and even though I researched the return policy, NOWHERE it was disclosed or clarified to me that I would have to pay out of pocket for the return. This is a deceitful practice.
Item is presented as a 'movable' treadmill but it is TOO HEAVY. Once installed you cannot really put it away easily. Don't Buy.
Also, packaging came broken and with different tapes, which makes me think this is an item that was returned by someone else already."
Worst $300 I've ever spent. I was really looking forward to this treadmill but unfortunately you pay for what you get. This thing does not work at all and I almost killed myself trying to walk on it. I really wish I didn't have to return this thing since it's so large and heavy but unfortunately since I can't fix it I will be returning it which sucks
"Easiest assembly. I only have one working arm and I easily got out of box and assembled on my own. Started right up! Also, it has wheels and slides easily under my bed. I live in a small studio and it fits perfect. It is also very quiet and my neighbor below me cannot hear it!
Highly recommend!
The company is also very nice and if you have any problems they will help you ASAP!"
"worst !!! when I opened it, everything was broken
ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬"
"Received product broken, as soon as I opened the box I had to put it back in, didn't even get the chance to use it, very disappointed.
Update:
The company has been very helpful with sending me a replacement cover and helping me with the issues I am having. The machine at first was stopping during a walk but it no longer does that. It works just fine now. Once I get the cover I will update with a new picture."
Pretty nice treadmill. No need to do much installation at all. Lots of static electricity due to the metal shell and handle during/ after workout. Remember to add grease before using the machine. Overall a nice one for WFH.
"I wanted a very compact treadmill for daily walking to keep my cardio up now that I sit at a home computer all day. This is very small, very light, but works very well. I love the handle because it allows me to have a handhold and a place to put my phone or iPad while in use, but I can easily fold it down if I want to store it. I store it under a couch, it really is that flat. No, it's not as good as the units at your local gym, but for the price I am shocked at how good it it. If you just want to walk at a brick pace, this thing is all you need.
One note on shipping, this unit had all of the features I wanted but had a longer ship time than other units. Mine arrived about early, so I was very pleased by that. No guarantee, but it shipped much faster than advertised for me."
I was looking for something to stay fit during the pandemic and stumbled upon this. I was worried given the price it might be not of great quality but I was super happy when I received this. The build quality is great and the set up was super easy. It's not bulky and does not fit in small places. A great treadmill for smaller apartments I must say. Also the assembly is super easy . The accessories such as the remote control and the tablet holder are super convenient to watch and control the speed while working out. Given its price I would highly recommend this product.
"Yes. It looks different. I was skeptical as well before I placed order.
Like everyone else, I am used to a big control panel and hand support. The more complicated, the fancier it looks. But, think again, when you run outside, do you use a hand support or control panel? All you need is a runway. Right? This excise machine does exactly that. And for a very reasonable price.
I am always confused by the steep price tag of these big machines. All I need is a moving belt that I can run on.
So after removing the control panel etc., it actually folds better and save a lot of places.
As to the basic function, it runs pretty smooth. It weights about 50 pounds and can handle about 200lbs. - not for the big guys.
If you are like me - watching videos when excising, it does have a support for tablets.
All I want to say is for this price, you cannot go wrong - it has the basic function that satisfy your needs."
I was looking for a compact, small and easy to put away treadmill and I found it in this one. It feels sturdy and isn't too noisy. Love the remote so I can easily change speeds and stop .I am doing 30 minutes a day and am happy with the quality and ease of use.
Did not want a huge machine, wanted something that I could use in our small home and store out of sight. This is it. Item was easy to remove from the box and set up - just lift the handle bar and lock in place. Plug it in, turn it on, and you're good to go. Treadmill is quiet and stable. The treadmill's handlebar folds easily for storage. Then just lift the machine onto its wheels and store it upright in a closet or against a wall, or under your bed. A small bottle of oil comes with the treadmill so you can apply the oil to the belt every week. A great little machine for the price.
This is the perfect little treadmill for a small space. I bought this to aid me in keeping healthy with indoor exercise. I run often and for many miles at a time. This has been perfect! Easy to move by myself and assemble. It doesn't take up a lot of space and is collapsible. It isn't loud or noisy when operating. so far so good. Very satisfied and recommended.
This is exactly what I was looking for! I wanted an inexpensive treadmill with a small footprint so I can walk daily, even when the weather isn't conducive to outdoor walking. This does the trick! It was a breeze to set up, and I walked for twenty minutes right away while talking on the phone. It was quiet and easy to use. Time will tell how it'll hold up, but so far so good!
I bought this treadmill for my daughter, which can let her run at home. It is very good, not big in size, and can be folded up. Very convenient.
It is easy to keep it underneath my sofa, not so heavy and i can slide it in as there is two wheels on one end and slanted to move it in. Speed is upto 6 and can set 2 more modes like time and calorie burns and distance. Just took out in the box as is and just installed the handle which can be put down after done working out. Good thing there is a remote and can access using it only. There is a switch red button in front side and can adjust the height so it can hold ti the floor so it will move when i run.like it and affordable for its kind!
No assembly - easy to use. Fits perfectly in small spaces and can be hidden under a bed when guests come to visit. Also, it is amazingly quiet.
A well-made, light-weight and sturdy treadmill. During pregnancy, I was able to move it carefully because it is so light. It can be folded, so it takes up limited space. I have used it with a cushion under the carpet and floor, and it works perfectly on both. I like it very much!
It can not be turned on and the seller did not pay the refund shipping cost.
Didn't really have any dislikes. It's compact , works great, and good for the price.
I've been using this treadmill for a week now, it's worked well for me and it wasn't much to assembled, just its little heavy to get it out of the shipping box. It's compact, semi small and fits well in my small bedroom, after done using it, i can fold and push it under my bed. Definitely recommend if u need nice compact treadmill for home use.
Exercising and strengthening immunity against viruses Perfect ï¼size for a small area. Easy to assemble even though a couple of parts were missing. Found suitable parts in my tool box to complete the assembly.
"Doufit TD-01 Folding Treadmill is a great treadmill for your home or even office. I love that this is a compact treadmill and it saves a lot of space. It has a nice durable handle that folds down flat. You're able to easily move the treadmill because it has wheels. This treadmill will fit under a couch, bed, or even a desk making it easy to store.
Don't let the compact size fool you. The folding treadmill's operating system is strong and powerful. When the handle bar is down this the perfect walking treadmill. When you raise the handle bar you're able to jog. You can easily adjust the speed of this treadmill by using the remote. You're able to choose a speed from 0.6mph to 3.7mph.
I really liked that I didn't have to spend a lot of time putting it together. Most of the work was already done, I just had to connect the phone holder. The phone holder is the perfect size for your phone or even a tablet.
I'm really impressed with the quality of this treadmill. If you're looking for a treadmill that's a space saver, this is it.
Dimensions: 53˜' x 20˜' x 39.5'˜
Weight: 56 pounds"
"This treadmill is really suitable for the small places. The remote works just fine even though without pointing it to the treadmill. Quick start and has speed up to 6m/hr which I think enough for the home gym.
I'm making good use of the treadmill in this covid and winter time.
The finished looks classy and the belt makes no noise.
Make sure to lube the belt time to time for running is smoother."
"UPDATE: Oct/9/20: I've been using the treadmill for 30 days, every day, I walk at a 3.0 speed for A total of 2-3 hours while I work in my home office. Or after work while I watch TV. I could go faster, but 3.0 Speed feels comfortable to me. I burn about 400 calories per day and I've started eating less junk food. I remember reading the reviews a month ago and thinking I want to do that!  I want to lose weight... Well, it didn't take much time... I lost my first 15 lbs. and I am motivated to keep going!
Getting this treadmill was the best decision I could ever make to improve my health!
First Review:
I received a treadmill that probably got damaged during shipping. I contacted the seller and he/she replied right away. They sent me a new treadmill (yeay! No issues!)
I was very impressed about the quick response, resolution and wonderful customer support provided by the seller ( wow! A+ ). Thank YOU!
I have tried my new treadmill and it feels very sturdy, well calibrated and overall, it will work to help me achieve my fitness goals.
The treadmill is heavy, but easy to lift from the back and roll to reposition anywhere in the house (small wheels in the front).
I placed the treadmill in front of my desk, but I could easily hide under the bed or inside my walk-in closet.
I can use with or without the arm support. This part can be aligned with the base or lifted at 90-95 degrees. I can place my phone or iPad and listen to music while I walk. I can see the increments in time, calories, distance and steps and increase my speed as I become more comfortable with my steps. There is a magnetic safety plug that will stop the treadmill in case needed. This treadmill has all the features I was looking for and more!
I am 5'5 and weight 160 lbs. After using for one full hour continuously I did not experience any significant issue in performance. The treadmill did not damage my floors, but of course I'll get a mat to protect them, just in case.
I was looking at other options before I decided to buy this treadmill. My budget was a factor, but also, I found similar treadmills at twice the price. I could not justify a $500 machine that I could get for half the price.
Overall, I am very happy with this purchase, the treadmill is solid (really very similar to the $500 ones) and I would definitely buy more from this seller."
I ordered this treadmill a few days ago because I just started a desk job and I need to be able to stay active in all seasons but I live in an apartment so I needed something small. It was delivered 4 days earlier than expected and I was so excited! I set it up and did notice the belt wasn't centered, the instructions were a little vague but I looked up a few YouTube videos and I think I got everything balanced correctly, regular set up literally takes only Minutes. It's the perfect size and the belt doesn't feel skinny like a lot of reviews for other small treadmills say. I also think it looks great! It's very quiet but the buttons beep pretty loudly (for reference it sounds almost exactly like a microwave's beep) I will update my review if anything goes wrong with it, being that it's only day one but it seems great! As you will see in one of my pictures the remote and manual can sit in the console if you plan to have the console up most of the time, like I do. Oh and I do live in a very old building, where the breakers frequently trip but this treadmill doesn't seem to cause any issues with that, for anyone wondering.
Just received today 12/3. Was delivered to my door with care. Packaged very secure and quality is perfect. It is perfect!!!! I tested it already really quiet. On second floor no noise.. the bar goes up or down. Remote works even far away. Has couple programs. Easy to slide under my bed. So happy with it.. now I need to break it in and hope it continues to keep me happy. Read great reviews and feel it will... the value is worth the money... I'm excited to get my cardio in while working from home. I highly recommend. Only thing I wish it would do is incline for better fat burner..
I am a college professor and have been told that the fall and spring semester will be online from home. I bought this incredible, small but powerful treadmill to slide under my standing desk. I wanted to walk and light jog while correcting papers and preparing lectures. The handle is retractable, so I put it in the down position. This treadmill is comfortable with enough belt room to walk with a big stride. It is built well, had a remote, and tracks calories, miles, time, and miles per hour. It has a speed of up to 6.5 miles per hour which is a nice fast pace for running. I walk at 4.5 miles per hour and work up a good sweat and gets my heart rate up. It is small, but has a big walking/running belt. Front wheels make it easy to move around. With the cold weather coming... I definitely recommend.
I have been looking around for an affordable under desk treadmill and stumbled on this one. I will admit, I was skeptical given the few reviews and the lower price. I paid $299.99 plus tax, I ordered it on August 24 and received on August 31. It does exactly what I needed. I have used it most of the morning as setup only took a few minutes. The only downside so far is the app and remote are less than good. I have been using the control panel to change speeds, etc.
"Disclaimer: We bought this treadmill to replace a traditional treadmill that bit the dust. We did not expect this treadmill to ""compete"" with our dead one.
Some observations:
1) It takes a while for the belt to ""settle"" on this treadmill. I have to re-tighten it before I run to make sure it's tight enough. If it is NOT tight enough, it slips around while you walk or run and is truly terrifying.
2) To lower or raise the bar, you have to loosen or tighten the screws on the sides each time. So it takes extra time to fold and store the treadmill. We just keep it set up because of this, but it doesn't take up much space when set up, so it works for us.
3) The size of the treadmill ""track"" is perfect. We were concerned it would be too small/narrow, but it is just right.
4) The size of the phone/tablet holder is great for iPad minis or large phones. Full size tablets might be too large to fit without worrying about falling off the holder. However, you do have to look down to view the device, which is probably not the best ergonomic position for the neck while you exercise.
Overall, we would recommend this treadmill if you need to accommodate a small space and don't mind taking the extra time to make adjustments to the treadmill before and after each use. It's a good price for what you get, too. But next time, we'll probably bite the bullet and spend the extra money on a ""full size"" treadmill again."
"Item arrived with a large piece of the plastic side panel broken I can blame that on the carrier or distributor, I suspect it was already broken when shipped because there was no plastic rattling around in the treadmill or in the box. The side panels also don't sit flush with the back of the machine. These are minor gripes and if I could dock partial stars it would take off a fraction.
The main reason this doesn't get 5 stars in my books is the folding handlebars don't lock into place. They're held tight by two bolts screwed tight and is fine if you set up your treadmill and leave it but is terrible for constantly folding and moving around. The weight of the entire machine is enough to loosen the folding bar. DO NOT MOVE THE MACHINE BY USING THE FOLDING BARS. The main machine is liable to just fall and crash on your feet or worse. There is a aprox. 1in bar on the rear under the belt that runs almost the entire length of the treadmill. If they had just extended that bar and added some spring lock pins that locked into a couple of holes on the handlebars it would be solid enough to move around in my opinion. Or even made the beam longer and so you could grip that and have the folding arms rest on that bar.
Everything else is fine, Maybe hire a better translator for the instruction manual ""explosive list"" might not be the words you want to use for listing parts xD."
So far so good. I needed a treadmill that could be stored away and this one slides under my bed. It's pretty sturdy and quiet. It takes minutes to set up. I chose this treadmill because it has a stronger motor than others in the same price range.
"We really love this treadmill. We live in a 600 sqft apartment and both me and my partner are working from home. We used to walk to work prior to COVID, and being in the city, its difficult to keep your distance while walking. We bought this treadmill in anticipation of winter. But also for convenience of walking whenever we wanted.
The fact that we can use it without the bar upright is an amazing feature. We have sit to stand desks and can roll it under the desk and walk while working. It's not as distracting as it sounds. We average about an hour a day and we have had it for a month. So far so good. We rarely put it away, but if we want to, it stores under the couch without issue. I have also run on this treadmill with the bar up and it has been great for that as well (only up to 6 mph, so can't speak to anything faster than that). I am 5'4"" and it is comfortable running on it. My partner is 5'11"" and said he would have a difficult time running on it comfortably. I'd say there are only two cons. it is heavy, but honestly, with all of the mechanics that go into a treadmill, it is to be expected. It can be picked up, but you'll need 2 people. It has wheels in the front and I can wheel it around just fine by myself. The other con is that the distance tracked is not even close to accurate, but the steps and times are, so you could figure out the distance quite easily. We just want to excercise, so it's not a huge deal to us.
This treadmill shipped and arrived earlier than estimated. This is a really great value for what you get. It's a fantastic buy for a small place."
"I should have know by the price. It is a product of China. Not meaning anything about their quality. Just that it doesn't have a proper description. It has a 1.5hp motor and with my weight 250 pounds 111Kg it suffers. I can't use it. If you are a small person of about 150 pounds or less It should work just fine. I should have known it was not made in North America or South America. I don't believe it could have been sold for that low of a price.
Buyer Beware."
I am very impressed with this product, especially for the price. I place it underneath my standing desk and it is perfect. The setup was simple and it runs well. Customer service is also amazing! I received a damaged power cord (not the seller's fault), I messaged them about it and they got back to me within 24 hours and shipped a new cord to me the next business day. Highly recommend!!!!
It arrived broken. Hard to get in touch with third party to get money back and to arrange pick up for return shipping.
The treadmill arrived quickly and set up was a breeze. The book mount on the handle is slightly small, but I can still prop my ipad up to read while I'm walking. It's very quiet and easy to move as well. I keep it under the bed in my spare bedroom/office and it's easy to slide in and out. Bluetooth speakers are easy to connect to, and the sound is decent. The app is a little 'odd' so I quit using it. During the first use, the LED display froze (instead of toggling through distance, speed, step and calories) and when I turned it off and back on, the LED display didn't come on at all. I contacted the seller, who responded within hours, requesting a short video of the problem so they were clear on the issue. After reviewing my video, they suggested a cable had come loose during transport. They said they would send me a new cable, just in case the cable was bad. That resolution seemed fair, so I agreed, and also asked them to include instruction on how to perform the replacement. The seller again responded very quickly with instructions on how to check the cable connections first. The instructions were very easy to follow (they also included pictures) and I was able to take the cover off and confirm that all cables/wires were connected but the LED display still did not come on. I took a few pictures of the inside of the unit and responded back to the seller. Again, within hours they responded with a tracking number for what I assumed would be a new cable for the display. When the shipment arrived, it was an entirely new treadmill!!! Needless to say I was very surprised. I emailed the seller to confirm a new unit is really what they meant to send, and they again responded within hours letting me know that yes, that was their intention. The new unit is working perfectly so far and I couldn't be happier with it. Now that I have an LED display, I have used a few of the programmable modes as well. This little treadmill has really great features and I believe it will hold up very well in the future.
Great device for smaller people I'm 6'1 210lbs & it's just too small but overal great value for the price if you are say 5'5 or under like described great for office or light workout.
For around $300, this treadmill is just what I need to add some exercise during my daily work from home schedule. It's the perfect size for my office and didn't need any assembling. I took it right out of the box, plugged the power cord in and turned the switch on. It started beeping which alerted me to put the safety key on. It's felt heavier than expected but since I won't be moving it around much it didn't bother me. Worked wonderfully for the money I paid. I didn't expect it to feel like a treadmills that are three times as expensive and it didn't. But it works for what I purchased for and it worked better than I expected.
"I recently purchased this to be used as an under-desk treadmill to burn calories while I work. It serves the basic purpose, which is that it's small, doesn't need the railing up to work, has a remote, and allows me to walk while I work with no issues. I will say, if you are planning to run on it, this treadmill is not for you, and none of these ""mini"" treadmills probably would be.
My primary issue with this product is the units of measurement.
Steps: pretty accurate compared with the step counter on my Samsung phone in my pocket.
Distance: Hard to tell. Seems somewhat in-line with step count, but doesn't line up with the SPEED measurement AT ALL.
Speed: I walk with the speed at ""1.5"" ... That means it should take me well over 30 minutes to walk a mile. I can tell you from the feel that I am walking more than 1.5Mph, and the treadmill registers a mile @ 20 minutes which would be 3Mph. So is that ""1.5"" in Km/h? No, because 1.5Mph would transfer to 2.4km/h.
So basically, other than a decent estimate of steps, there is no way to record your speed or distance correctly. I have reached out to the seller for info and will update if I hear back."
Nice but didn't work for very long. The first time using it it would randomly turn off and completely lost all power.
Handlebar loosens and won't stay tight. Very unsafe, wouldn't recommend this treadmill to anyone. Vendor contacted and no solution to the problem. Purchased warranty but no response for repair or fix. Treadmill belt too narrow for normal sized person.
Like most others, I work completely from home and was beginning to feel my body just turning into a blob from sitting all day. After hours and days of researching rising desks and collapsible treadmills, I ran into this gem and decided it would be the perfect addition to my new home office. This fits perfectly under my new desk, doesn't take up too much space, and with a little muscle, can be stored upright and out of the way when I need to sit in a chair. The installation (if we even want to call it that) was super easy and finished within minutes. It isn't entirely quiet... people can hear me walking during a zoom call, but it isn't disruptive or a dealbreaker. The app does suck, so I wouldn't buy it for that feature. If anyone figures out a way to link it to Apple health or something that is actually convenient, I'll be jumping for joy. Otherwise, this thing is still a fantastic buy and I'd highly recommend it if you want to exercise without realizing it.
So far, great value, no setup really but had to adjust the belt which was really easy. The step counter is spot on as is the time but the distance is way off compared to smart watch and another app, when I hit 4 miles, the treadmill says 7.5. Great for fast walking and moderate jogging I always use under the desk so dont use the controls on the handle . The manual references an app but havent figured out how that connects. Its kind of heavy but easy enough to move around with the wheels. I store it along side the bookshelf for now. says bluetooth and speakers but havent seen or used that.
"I've had it a few weeks. Delivery was quick. Set up easy. It's nice & quite .
It was missing some parts & the seller was quick to respond. I was hoping they'd send what was on manual (iPad holder & cup holder) but they'd sent the wrong manual.
They did send the iPad holder along with other items I now have 2 of. No cup holder. (which the new manual doesn't show). Apparently there's 2 different treadmills from this brand.
I haven't tried the app.
Wish there was a memory of previous workouts.
But, Overall, very happy with this purchase."
"So I purchased this mini treadmill
on November 5th of 2020 and received it about a week later! I wanted to try it out and give it some good use before writing a review.
I use this a minimum of one times per week. But, more often than not I use it 4-5 time a week for about 45-60 minutes in the morning, though sometimes twice a day. The speed goes up to 6.2 which is a great jogging speed (for me), there are adjustable feet casters incase you're floors are uneven (which is great since I live in a 100 year old house)! I will often jog the whole hour on it and it does excellent with no skipping, and has a nice smooth belt, thought the width of the treadmill is definitely narrow, I've just learned to be mindful of it.
I am 5 foot 6 and roughly 150lbs give or take depending on the day ðŸ˜…, and I would definitely say I can pretty much use my normal stride, but if you're too much taller you might have to adjust your stride a little.
That being said, I don't normal use this without the handrails up since I am rather clumsy (and was hesitant due to some of the reviews saying it can throw you off from th belt skipping, which I have never once experienced). I love walking on it and watching TV.
I have yet to try out the speakers (probably because I didn't know it had them ðŸ˜…) but I didn't buy it for that. Also, it is surprisingly well made and sturdy, I don't know what I was expecting, but for the price and size I figured I'd be made out of flimsy plastic, which isn't the case! It is plastic, but it's definitely a thick plastic, with metal handrails and sturdy feet.
Overall, I love my little treadmill, it folds and fits perfectly under our guestroom bed. It is, fairly quite, but I still wouldn't use it while my husband is sleeping as it's still a little too loud for my taste (again I live in a very old house with paper thin walls) so otherwise I would say the noise level would be fine in a different room. It came pretty well packaged and is easy enough to roll around. So far in the few month I've owned it, it's been a great investment, only time will tell how long it lasts but I'll keep you posted!!"
"I only use this at a walking desk and it works GREAT!
Pro:
-The treadmill comes with a remote
-Can be controlled via an app on the phone
-Is built very well
-Perfect little walking treadmill
Con:
-DO not buy IF YOU want a running treadmill unless you are 4'6""
-The bar is NOT removable
-Must keep the magnet on the treadmill even when the bar is down
This treadmill is the perfect little addition to any standing desk. Use it to get more steps in and stay healthy! I do not recommend this treadmill as a running replacement but definitely the right price and footprint for walking.
I love this treadmill."
"I just received this a few hours ago. It was incredible easy to get set up at my work-station. I am really enjoying it. I sit in front of a computer ALL DAY. This is life-changing.
The only con is that the shipping was a nightmare, but I recommend this little treadmill. It would be 5 stars if the shipping hadn't had been so abysmal."
"So far this has been a solid purchase, and a value for the money spent. Delivered within 10 days (cross country) No damage and ready to go after unpacking. It isn't silent, but reasonably quiet. So far this treadmill seems sturdy, and I am very happy with this purchase.
Stats on the right ( distance & calories ) do not compute correctly, but the rest seem accurate. I use an app on my phone, so this doesn't matter to me. There is an app you can download with this machine, but I like the one I use.
I am glad to be able to keep my evening walks during the colder fall/winter months."
I like the fact that the treadmill came fully assembled. The price was good. Most treadmills run at least $200 more and you have to assemble them before you can start issuing them. I like that it does not take up a lot of space. I am 5'11" and I was worried about it not accommodating my stride, but it does. It reports all the information I need --time, speed, distance, steps and calories too. I have reccomended this treadmill to a friend. I read the reviews and checked out other treadmills and felt very confident buying this one.
"A treadmill that doesn't take up the whole room! looking forward to using it through the winter.
The treadmill works great so far. The bluetooth speakers are weak - but I didn't buy it to be a speaker. Any speaker or your phone would probably be better. I do wish the app was in the play store. I won't put apps from unverified sources on my phone - so I don't get the benefit of that."
"So I just received and unboxed this treadmill. Plugged it in and got an error code. It will not run. I am so disappointed. I spent a weeks shopping and reading reviews and out of a million choices, I choose the one that not only doesn't work, but isn't returnable to Amazon. I have to wait until the seller gets back to me. So now I don't have a treadmill, and I don't have my $350 to get another one.
I will update this whenever I get a response and see how their customer service is.
UPDATE: Awaiting replacement, will update again once received.
UPDATE: Received replacement today. Works great! Very quiet! My feet make more noise walking on this than the machine makes. Customer service was very responsive."
"We have a small space and were looking for a treadmill that did not take up much room and folded completely flat. This treadmill fit the bill perfectly. It is on the smaller side, so if you have a longer or wider stride, it may not work for you. It's somewhat heavy, but there are wheels on one side that make it easier to move. It's fairly basic and there are not a huge amount of features, but we were looking for something very basic and this works well for us. It is a great value for the price.
I do need to mention the excellent, friendly customer service that we received from the company. Our treadmill started making odd jolting movements after 11 days instead of running smoothly and continuously. I sent a video to the company - they replied quickly and even checked back in with me when I was slow to respond to their email! My video was forwarded to their engineers, and the company decided that it may have been damaged in delivery and that they would send us a new treadmill. The new one arrived very quickly and so far it is working well. Very satisfied with both the treadmill and the service we received."
We were looking for a treadmill, nothing huge but something that would get the job done. I just got done walking 5 miles literally and I am very pleased with this purchase. It came ready to use, all we had to do was put the bar on. I am really looking forward to using this daily.
"I just purchased and was delivered very quickly.
Easy to set up. It's sturdy though a bit heavy. Had help getting it upstairs but wheeling it around is pretty easy by myself. 5'3"" in my 60s.
At first it was a bit noisy on the left side, it's on carpet so I put a small door mat under the front and is now very quiet.
Overall very pleased. Price, sturdiness, ease of setting up, quiet, perfect for walking/light jogging. If you are really tall it might be a bit short for your stride.
We'll see how it holds up."
"I've been using this treadmill under my desk for a little over a month now for walking only (10K steps a day), and it's been great so far. Part of the red plastic siding did shatter in shipping, but that's purely aesthetic so I don't really care. At one point I thought I had an issue and the seller was extremely responsive and helpful (ended up being user error of course).
The step counter isn't very accurate for me, but I have long legs. I'm 6'2"" with no issue as far as the treadmill being too small. It's a bit heavy- no problem for me, but a smaller person might struggle a bit. Does have wheels on the front to make it easier to move around. It will stand straight up and down by itself so easy to store.
Overall, it's great for the cost, and I highly recommend. I'll update here if I ever have any issues with it down the line."
It works well, isn't too loud, and is low profile, but very heavy and cumbersome so it is not that easy to move around.
It is scary to use this equipment above a slow pace as it jerks often than nearly stops. Am trying to locate the seller to get it fixed for free. Not holding breath on service.
I absolutely love this treadmill, it is perfect for what I needed and a great value! The first one I received was busted up and broken, the seller immediately responded and sent me a new one the next day. I received the second one quickly and it is perfect. I enjoy getting to use it every day! Highly recommend for the value!
The treadmill sticks and is hard to even walk on much less run on it. Unfortunately I'm not interested in buying something I have to fix and oil constantly. Wish I could return it
Exactly what I wanted! There was no way I would be able to assemble a treadmill and this was ready to go out of the box. It goes faster than I can fast walk and even jog so i havent experienced any of the skipping that other reviews have noted. I had initially saw an online ad for another brand that was more than double this price so I am extremely happy I decided to get this one before the more expensive one. I was mainly looking for something to get some movement in to counter my sedentary 8 hours WFH workday. It's perfect for getting my step count up without the inconvenience of leaving my house if I dont want to walk outside. I am very happy with my purchase.
"5 STARS because this is exactly the right fit for my needs and price point. If you are looking for something to walk, brisk walk, or a slow jog this is the treadmill for you. It is extremely narrow and short, so get off balance and sway 2 inches to either side could be VERY dangerous. If you are a pro-runner, this is not the treadmill for you.
I give it five starts because it fits my needs, is small and doesn't take up much room, is lighter in weight , easy to move around, and can't beat the price!"
This treadmill is seriously perfect for my apartment. It is so thin that it fits under my couch! I simply just slide out my couch and there it is! I love that I can collapse it and it comes with an plastic extension to set me phone or iPad on to watch shows while I walk! I was nervous about it being sorry but it has held up great! I don't feel like I'm going to break it, however I only power walk on it and never run but it's great for me so far. I think it was well worth the money! It even comes with a remote for when you don't want to put the railing part up which is great if you want it under a standing desk!
My husband and I wanted something that we could put right next to our couch while watching TV. In this pandemic, it's impossible to get steps in. I'm happy to say that we've been walking on this every day for about 40-80 minutes (depending on how much time we have). It's really easy to walk at a brisk pace on this while watching TV or listening to a podcast, and it's perfect to get that step count in even on rainy days (I live in Seattle lol). Will update this review if my feedback changes, but for now I really love it!
It arrived and was immediately not functioning. The motor was loud and ran, but the belt did not move. Disappointed.
I've only had it for 10 days or so, but I love it so far! It's easy to move around and can fit under my bed. Took less than ten minutes to put together. I don't find it loud so it's easy to watch tv. I also just stick my laptop on the little shelf. This is probably not recommended because the shelf is not really designed for that, but it works for me. I've reached my 10,000 steps goal every day! Customer service was excellent! Had a small problem and they responded almost immediately. Very happy with my purchase!
The size is perfect. My husband did not have any trouble putting it together. There was a small broken cover when it arrived and the replacement part showed up quickly at no charge. The only thing missing is my energy!! Truly love it being quite and easy to set my pace for the day. It is on low pile carpet and there isn't any issues. I could not be happier!! Would recommend for anyone's use that wanted to walk. I don't do running or jogging so that part I don't know about. But the stride seems short if you want to run. But I have not tried it. Too old for that.
I absolutely love this treadmill! It is light and easily stored. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that higher priced ones have but the cost more than makes up for it! Besides, I just want to hop on, set the speed and start jogging not spend time programming it.
This product is a bit heavy for 1 person to get up and down steps. As mine does work, the lights on the screen are messed up so I do not know what they say. I wish I could read the steps because that's something I would like about this treadmill. Also at first my kit did not come with a cup holder or the IPad holder. I had them send me a new one and did not get the cup holder. So I guess it does not come with one. Other than the screen, the treadmill works well.
"This treadmill is great! It's compact and easy to maneuver from being tucked away to being use, and folded up and tucked away again! While compact, there's plenty of runway space. Both me and my husband, who is 6'4, are able to maintain our natural strides without fear of running out of ramp.
Additionally, the seller is wonderfully attentive. I experienced some issues with delivery but the seller was lightning quick in response and provided various resolution options. Would definitely buy from again."
Product had setting issues and seller stepped up to replace the unit.. 5stars on customer service
Just what I needed since I don't go to the gym anymore due to the virus.
Adjusting my original review because the company was so great about communication. This is a good price and was easy to setup. It's heavy and not terribly easy to maneuver around but it's great if you're looking for something that won't take up a lot of space, this is a nice option. The bar can be up or down, which I like so I can put it under my desk. The bar is annoying to readjust because you need the little tool; I'd prefer that this would have been a built-in option but it's not a total deal breaker. Overall good value!
I bought this to get our family a little bit more active during Covid and to use it as a walking treadmill under my stand up desk. It functions great! We put it in the family room. My preteens frequently walk on it while we watch a family movie, and when we're done with it, we slide it under the couch. I walk on it for exercise, about 3 miles a day, and then I can log another 2 to 4 miles during the workday at my desk.
This treadmill is AMAZING for walking and getting things done! I only use it to walk. I bought it ONLY for walking. I do other things while WALKING. It is on the shorter side, but that is why I bought it!
I've been using this since October and I've been using it 4 days a week. But now it seems like the motor is going out on it. Even when I crank it up to full speed it seems to me like its stuck at 5 maybe 5.2. Don't know why the problem could be besides that.
The treadmill is working exactly as it was describe. It is a bit heavy but the rollers on the bottom make it easy to move around. The accessories kit was missing when the package arrive but I contact the seller and gather sent it right away. Took about 5 days for the kit to get here. But the tread mill is working great and I use it for walking. Make sure to add some lubricant.
Suddenly stopped working after less than 6 months. Very disappointed because I was so happy with it. Too expensive an item to just flop like that in under a year. No response from seller.
The track sometimes skips, so I have to watch my tread on it, but otherwise, it's a steady workhorse and reliable. It's what I could afford.
Have had it for 1.5 months, was fine until I tried running on it instead of fast walking. Now the motor is making a loud noise at all speeds. I am literally less than 20 days past the return day and I am livid. I really liked this treadmill but this is ridiculous.
This is a great treadmill for running and walking. One thing that I don't like is that there is no pause button it's start or stop, but that's not terrible. It's sturdy. 0 assembly required. Has a blue tooth speaker that works well. App that connects to the treadmill has to stay open and doesn't connect to the health app or fitness pal, but nevertheless it lets you keep track of distance time and calories.
This treadmill looks very good. it can be folded into tablet and put under the office desk so i can work out during working fm home. Isn't it amazing? so easy and convenient. 20' every day. works stable and the price is good. highly recommended.
Just got it and so far quite impressed with quality and function. Pretty much exactly what I wanted. Setup took mere minutes and no assembly. Quiet, stable, easy to use. I plan to use it for brisk walking. Would be a bit small for jogging but it's sturdy enough for that. Very happy w my purchase. Four stars since it's too early to make a solid determination, but so far I love it.
"My treadmill was damaged in transit. After submitting a video to customer service, a replacement was shipped to me the next day. Great service!
I have used the treadmill once so far with my standing work desk. It is no louder than other treadmills, but seems loud because it is typically quiet while I work. A set of noise-cancelling headphones solved the problem, and I am looking forward to using this every day!"
"for the price its awesome BT speakers arent the greatest but machine makes up for that
very easy to use and put a way"
The main thing I was looking for was the low noise everyone was talking about but mine is very noisy. The lubricant came open so everything was full of oil other than those two things its perfect very sturdy fits in small places love the product.
Loved it but it came damaged. Part of the frame was broken and out of place
Had it for a week and so far so Good! Not very noisy and very sturdy. Loved it!
"Great treadmill for a wfh office
Using it while working on my computer"
Great small treadmill! A little narrow, but I have no problems walking/running. Fairly quiet for a treadmill - can not hear it with ear buds in. Great price point and arrived on time undamaged.
i love it , super compact , perfect for small spaces, no assembly required , took me just about 5 min to set up
Love it! I really wasn't sure what I was going to get at this Price, but it's been great.
Treadmill is everything my wife wanted with small footprint and phone app. We received prompt reply to a request for help by email when unit did not power on properly. Customer service sent clear instructions how to fix the problem and got it working. They saved me a lot of trouble from having to return it.
So far so good. Love how compact it is. Easy set up. Doing the job ! I can finally run again. Perfect for small spaces.
The customer service is wonderful! They helped me with all my questions. Thank you.
Easy setup and easy to use. Highly recommend.
Will buy again
Arrived packaged nicely. Although heavy, it was came already together so no assembly was required. No complaints so far!
I love the treadmill. It is everything I wanted. It's light for easy maneuverability. I had a question so I emailed customer service, and they responded in a very short time. They took care of everything I needed. If I could, I'd give their customer service a 10+ rating.
This was terrible it broke 1 WEEK after I got hit. Cheapily made piece of junk!! And they didnt let me return it.
Exactly what I was looking for. Easy to fold up and put away.
The treadmill works fine as described, but it started to play weird sounds at random times, such as phone ringing, radio sounds, people speaking, etc. It is very freaky/scary, happens at random times during the day, once even in the middle of the night.
Now if she'll only use it . . .
I love the machine it works good everything but the only thing was it was cracked. Just took it out the box today.
Its very dangerous. I had it on regular walking speed on 3.0 and belt kept stopping. I'm afraid to set the speed higher. Its great otherwise but scary when you're walking and sort of trip because the belt stops.
item not working out in the box. got E-7 on the screen
"So very happy with this treadmill. Perfect size for small bedroom and perfect to get a workout in.
I recommend getting this"
An overall good product for the price.
Super easy easy set up and just what I needed under my desk for my at home office! No issues! Would definitely recommend.
The machine is sturdy, but the base is not wide enough to support my stride width.
Like its space saving size
Over all a good treadmill, great for small places and good for a quick run! I love mine
AWFUL! Didn't work; cost us 110$ to send back!
Had an issue with shipping but the seller took care of it immediately. Great treadmill! slims Down for easy storage
Love how small it is and foldable. Wish it could go faster but literally perfect for my small apartment and not being able to go to gym right now.
"So far so good, it's a bit heavy but it works for what I need it to.
The only thing was the delivery ( wasn't very efficient) done my FedEx and not amazon"
I love that it's small and can be folded and hidden under a bed quickly. It's also thin so i can leave it out and it doesn't take up much space or look bulky.
I liked that it wasn't bulky, disliked the display not being up top and not having speakers for my music that I could see.
Sturdy good value for your money and it's small
Small enough to easily move around and store.
So so so happy with my purchase, does its job. The Bluetooth is a plus! Overall great
Used for a losing weight and maintains good. So far it's working for me
"This has been a blessing being able to walk indoors during the winter.
Love it!!!"
"Works well for my wife's daily quick walking routine.
She likes it alot!"
Love it!
Love it! Works great. Nice and quiet.
Everything it easy to handle.
It very good.
"Just got my unpacked and it's still quite cumbersome for a 5'1 woman but for my purposes of using it under a standing desk it's still fairly compact
HOWEVER, as I start using once over 2 MPH or so the belt will randomly stop, or slip or stutter causing me to nearly fall even when I'm holding on. It ALMOST seems like I'm too heavy for it but SURELY that is not the case.... considering it only starts to stutter at higher speeds. I can't trust it enough to work while I walk. I have to hold on to the desk for dear life when I'm using it. Making it useless for my intended purposes.
It also came without a safety clip (i'm using a magnet - and use it is secured properly and doesn't move and is not the cause of my aforementioned issue). I contacted the company about that prior to turning it on and testing it."
This treadmill is great if you don't have a lot of open space. It runs well and is really cute too. We love the fact that the handle bar can be folded down, so if you don't want the bars on the side you can just fold it down. It's a great feature.
"First of all, the sellers held on to the package past the point of expected delivery. I know this because FedEx said a label was created and there wasn't any delivery updates until I inquired with the company about the delay. Literally the day I inquired, there was movement regarding the shipping. The Company said that it was the fault of FedEx. ”Whatever. My excitement was still strong and I waited a full 4 weeks before it arrived.
I finally unboxed and used it and it's not going well. I did like the compact size. It seemed like I wouldn't need to worry about my kid (15mo old) getting hurt on it. However, the belt seems to be sticky. In that as I'm walking (3.0 speed) the belt will abruptly stop and start. This is all very quick and makes my movements jerky and I feel it's necessary to hold on to the bar for safety.
The measure of distance is completely off as well. It stated I went 2.8 miles, when I barely hit 1 full mile. I think it also under valued my calorie output as well.
Due to how sticky it is, we are going to lube this thing up (even though the directions state it's pre-lubed) and try again. It's very likely that we'll be returning this product in the next 24 hours. Not happy with this at all.
UPDATE: I used this treadmill again and bumped up the speed to 3.8 mph and the sticky belt went away. I also noticed when I was in a groove, the stop/start didn't happen as much. We'll keep this product, but I wouldn't recommend buying it."
I bought this treadmill for the last bit of my pregnancy. It was delivered today - we set it up & it is SO dangerous. The belt will stall after a few steps. It is not smooth & my husband and I both almost fell trying to use it. I'll be returning it because I do not feel safe at any speed.
"First off, there's something sketchy about the seller's shipping. They created a shipping label the day after my order, but they didn't actually give the box to FedEx. When I contacted them at the end of the original delivery window to ask what had happened, they gave me a nonsensical answer about FedEx arriving after business hours, but the tracking suddenly started updating the next day. The treadmill finally arrived about a week after the original estimated delivery window.
The next disappointment is that the folding handle has to be partially disassembled to be raised or lowered. The pictures made it look like you could just fold down the handle and put the treadmill away after using it, but that's only true if you're willing to spend several minutes loosening the bolts (and re-tightening them before the next use).
The biggest problem by far is that the belt doesn't run smoothly. It randomly snags and slips, especially at higher speeds. Up to around 3mph, I can walk on it without worrying about it too much. Much above that, the jerking makes me feel like I'm about to be tossed off. I wouldn't dare run on this near the top speeds.
Last, the distance display is way off. After walking at a supposed 3mph for an hour, it shows a distance of 7.5. The built-in step counter does seem to be accurate.
Overall, we're going to keep the treadmill. Given the price, the limitations are tolerable, but this definitely seems to be a case of ""you get what you pay for."""
Had machine less than a month. The treadmill kept reading out E9 which is not on the Manuel. Treadmill finally stop working. Return for full refund. Probably will no longer buy a small compact treadmill. You get what you pay for. My weight is less than 120 lbs so it's not a weight capacity issue
Nothing written in the manual for this. Received treadmill as a gift and right out of the box cannot get passed the e-9 blinking error. I tried everything possible with the safety magnet in place. There is no manual for any potential troubleshooting aside from the basic few listed in the unbranded pamphlet received with the treadmill. Will post photos shortly. It is quite maddening that I do not even get an opportunity to try this out.
This treadmill is not for built men above 200lbs. It's perfect for small figured people.
It arrived broken. The light turns on but that's it. It doesn't work. Embarrassing.
"Pros:
- Speed is over 3mph and most flat treadmills do not exceed that
- Bar goes up or down
- Looks nice
- I like the hand held remote
Cons:
- The track isn't very long I could never run on this as I can't even take a full step stride. I'm a male and 5'9
- One of the lights is out and this is brand new so I'm mad it was kind of a waste of money
- No cup holders
- The app is clunky and doesn't connect to the treadmill itself
- Noisier than I thought it would be"
"This is simply the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon. It is very poorly made with a very weak motor. It arrived in a damaged box, but I don't think the damaged box had any to do with the poor performance. It's simply a piece of junk and I cannot recommend that anyone purchase this treadmill or any of the treadmills that are of a similar model.
The motor is extremely weak and will jerk, making this treadmill dangerous."
This machine is great. Works as expected. Can hold this old mom-bod (200 pounder - hopefully not for long know what I'm sayin?) and performs with ease. I totally agree with other reviewers on the remote control - pretty much garbag-o but it does the trick. I wish the machine showed the distance in mph instead of km, but a quick print out of a conversion table fixed that issue. My ONLY "crap I wish it had this" is I totally wish it had a pause button on the remote. Otherwise, this is a treat. Arrived super fast, easy-peasy set up...I mean...it rocks.
Great for small spaces. Easy to assemble. Works great. Exactly what I needed.
"A little hard to get out of box I am 74.
Purchased this so my husband 82 with emphysema and on O2 24/7 could get exercise during the winter time. I use it also.
We use it on carpet and leave it up all the time in our bedroom and it looks fine.
It is a very nice treadmill."
This treadmill is the perfect size and easy to use. The first one I ordered was not working correctly and I contacted the manufacturer and they responded promptly. They were extremely helpful in assisting me with my issue and quickly sent out a replacement. I love my treadmill!
Works as well as the larger units without taking up too much space. It also folds down easily and can be slid under a couch or bed with ease. Highly recommended.
Love the treadmill, so easy to move around, foldable and the price you pay is worth it!
"I had been thinking for months to get a small indoor treadmill, ever since my office moved and I lost my ""Gym in the building"" convenience factor, which really hits you hard in the winter. I mean, who wants to leave their warm house and sofa to get in the car to drive to the gym during a snow storm. I didn't execute on the idea thought until it became clear that we were all going to be confined to our homes for weeks on end.
And am I happy I bought this. So far it's performing well. I will say a few things (none of it will make me give it less stars):
1. I bought it specifically to walk on, I did not buy it to run on. I think it's fantastic for walking and it's great to break a good walking sweat as well.
2. The ""speed"" mileage thingy is way off. No question about it. As a gym goer, I am keenly aware what my walking speed is and what my running speed is. Let's just say at 5.6 mph at the gym, I be getting into a running mode for sure....that's my fast walk on this little darling. Do I care? No. I am breaking a sweat and I didn't intend to buy it for running. That being sad, if you crush out mileage and are a hardcore runner, this might not be the right treadmill for you. If you are a slow jogger, you could run on this, but don't try to emulate the 10mp speed when you get back to the gym. Wipe out potential would be high.
3. Distance monitoring: Also a bit whack on machine, but that's why I have my trusted fit bit.
All in all, it does exactly what I want it to do.
1. It seems to be well made. Heavy, but still able to move it around rather easily. 100% fits under bed or sofa. Brilliant!
2. It is quiet! I can use it in my apartment's spare room while watching a movie and no one can even hear me or it move. That's AWESOME.
3. I break my sweat and get my 6 miles a day in."
The instructions did not mention having to lubricate before first use, but mine was definitely not lubricated and started to snag after the first day of usage. To lubricate, lift the track with a screwdriver, reach under the track and empty one of the included lubricant bottles under the 2 areas where you're going to be landing your stride. Youtube has relevant videos.
It's perfect for what I'm I was looking for. The only problem was the handle and phone stand screws. It took me awhile to finally fit them and the phone stand screws didn't fit as well. I end up using my own screw (smaller) fits perfect and tight enough.
"This item is an amazing value at $400. Assembly took minutes and I was up and walking in no time. A couple of things worth noting:
~ Cannot collapse if you add the side arms.
~ The side power plug slightly extends the width to 25"" (hey, inches matter when you're in a small apartment!).
~ If you do not have the main bar up, you cannot go past 4.0 speed.
~ You cannot walk OR run on it without having the safety magnet plugged in.
~ the speeds posted aren't really ""real"" treadmill speeds. I'd say there's a 1.5 point conversion (Like, the 6.0 running feels more like my gym's treadmill at 4.5 fast walk).
~ the bluetooth signal on mine just says ""Media"" and since it has no pairing handshake, anyone can connect to it randomly (like my neighbor one night... scared the crap out of us when we were already in bed).
~ Speaking of my neighbor, he lives downstairs and said that it's not too loud... sounds like the dryer running (thin walls / ceilings in my apartment complex).
Keeping those things in mind and what I paid, I'm very happy with this purchase during lockdown. It has kept me sane."
Quality product, but the support arms are screwed in and once attached, the treadmill is no longer collapsible without removing the cover, taking a screwdriver, and unscrewing 4 screws. That is very deceptive advertising as the pictures don't explain that at all. As a regular treadmill, the belt does tend to slip a tiny bit as you walk at very slow speeds, but not that noticeable. I am still working on fine grain adjustments. I do wish you could switch between metric and imperial measurement, but it is metric only.
I am 75, and needed something like this. I showed a delicate young thing lifting it and rolling it around from place to place; so I figured I could manage it on my own. Ugh....delivery guy left it propped up against the garage about 5' front the mudroom door. (I have a sign on the door requesting pkgs be left INSIDE.) Took me quite a bit of effort to get it inside the door - no handles or handholds at all on the 75 lbs big rectangle. Too tired to do more that day. The next day, attempted to get it up the 4 steps thru the front door. Impossible; so had to slice the box and straps off to reach the treadmill. So heavy, ended up putting 2 small scrapes on the frame getting it inside my home. After that, put it together, but the tread didn't turn. A half dozen emails to the company didn't give any definite reason - but one day, I moved it yet again, and suddenly it worked. Has worked well ever since. Fortunate, because I'd discovered that it was unreturnable for any reason!! Anyway, the purchase of longer metric screws allowed me to attach the hand holds easier - and it is working well now. Still too heavy to move well- - but it runs smoothly and quietly and is quite satisfactory now. Hoping the initial set up goes better for you all.
"If you are looking for a cheap in home treadmill this is the one for you. It was easy to assemble. The only complaint I have and one that I have read in the reviews is the drag in the belt. I found that the higher the mileage you go the less you will feel and notice the drag. The Bluetooth connection was easy to set up. You won't be able to turn the volume up extremely loud otherwise it world put out more of a static sound. If you are running you won't be able to clearly here the music playing so that's a negative.
Last thing is you will need help with moving it to the location you want it to be once it is delivered. UPS dropped it off and the individual struggled to get it to my door. It wasn't until after delivery I realized they were at my door. I wished they had just rung the door bell to get some assistance. I had to drag it from my front door to my garage. It is heavy. Good thing is it wasn't damaged.
I've had it for about a month now and with the holidays have used it in between. I am enjoying it so far."
"When treadmill arrived the belt was slipping so much it would have been very easy to lose balance and get hurt. After a lot of oil & everyday use that issue has gone and then came back. However it is now making very weird noises. I would not feel safe running on this treadmill. A steady pace walk is ok, but I am scared to try running. If you are looking for a fairly priced treadmill to walk on I would recommend this treadmill. If you are a runner and want to run I would look elsewhere. Not trying to throw shade, just giving an honest review.
****Update****
I am not saying do not purchase this item, however it has been nothing but a problem for me. I've had it for a little bit over a month and this morning I turned it on and it is making weird noises. It sounds as if the motor is taking a crap. Complete waste of money. I would expect a treadmill that costs around $600 after taxes to last longer than a month."
BEWARE...This thing had a broken timer. It's small, as if it's for kids or dogs. It's dangerous to walk on because the walking area is so small, you could fall off. It says you can run on it, but that's a lie. It's also heavy, so don't think you could move it anywhere. It's advertised as light, no it's not. I also recommend buying prime as issues for returning the item may arise. Please don't buy this item. It really should be recalled for safety issues.
I really do hate leaving a bad review because I rarely give good ones, but on the other hand I never give bad ones. I usually just move on with my bad experience and never use the service/product again; never discouraging anyone from having their own potentially positive experience with something that didn't work out for me. However, customer service has just been lazy, people don't want to pick up a phone anymore, all of my concerns could have been addressed with a simple 5 minute call instead of 4 messages over the span of 1 week and still having the issue open. This treadmill worked for about twenty days and then I kept getting an Error message that shut off the machine instantly in the middle of runs leading to me almost falling off the thing. I said wow, issues already, that's not good. Let me just return it. When I submit my request to return it, I was sent directions on how to fix the treadmill. I'm so sorry but I'm not a hands on person and I just bought it brand new, why would I need to conduct repairs myself? They agreed to have me send it back and sent me a shipping label. When I take it to Fedex for drop off I'm informed that it needs to be packaged and it will cost $125 to custom package. I of course want to confirm I would be reimbursed for this before shipping, but they don't have anywhere I can call. So I have to lug this big thing back home and send another message through amazon. What happens, I am told its not economical for them to pay the packaging and once again I am given directions to fix it, but to rest assured they'll refund me if I can't fix it. That's great, but just give me my refund. I'm not trying to fix this broken machine that I have zero knowledge on only to have it breakdown and have to conduct repairs in another 20 days. Lets just stop with all the silly back and forth messages. Pick up the phone and call me, lets get this resolved quickly and efficiently. I'm assuming they were wanting me to just say the hell with it, I'll take the loss. Sorry guys this is a bad product and the customer service is lacking. I'm glad its sounding like your going to give me a refund, but how much time have we both wasted with this silly back and forth over a subpar product. We both have better things to do. I'm trying to lose some weight here for heavens sake, not sit on my phone or PC messaging you about my defective treadmill.
"I received this treadmill earlier today (after waiting for a few weeks since the purchase, an understandable issue due to COVID). I was very excited to receive it and unpacked it immediately. Upon reading the instructions and surveying all the contents of the package, it became clear that the remote controller was missing. I reached out to the manufacturer via email as this was the only method of contacting them on their official website. I later found their customer service number on a different website (that also had a significant number of poor reviews about the manufacturer [250 1 star reviews!]). I have been on hold for upwards of 45 minutes. In this time, I have also reached out to the seller through amazon (two different organizations as far as I can tell) and wrote this review to warn others about my experience.
As this product is inoperable, I am out ~$500, and customer service has been unresponsive as of yet, I am leaving a 1-star rating. I am open to editing this at a later time and changing the rating depending on how the issue is resolved. Buyer Beware!"
"Long term review..
Month three..
Used 2 hours per day almost every day.
Lubricated twice
Machine started running hot....over 230F under hood.
Machine started spitting out odd plastic shavings.
Machine came to a sudden stop while I was on a 4mph 36 min walk.
Waiting for resolution from company.
Good product just not sure on reliability
Got new motor got new motor belt....all good now
Quiet as a mouse.
But bad instructions.
And odd maintenance.
I bought my machine about a month ago.
I and my gf both use it each day for a total of 4+ hours a day. Weekend and days that are nice we go out to walk.
Its quiet as a mouse! I can walk or she can walk and the other can watch TV or do work no problem.
For indoor walking its perfect way to get 10k steps while listening to audable to watching TV.
Here are the issues.
1. Instructions are horrible! They are not easy to understand and it took me an hour to get the remote connected to the device. I still have no clue how to get the blue tooth to work. And it didn't say anything about lubrication of the best. Yes you should lube the belt! Instructions are online and they give you lube.
2. You should put it on a good matt. It doesn't have any shocks and if you have a heavy step like my gf.....you will shake your house. So get a yoga mat or some high density foam and put this on it.
3. It seems to collect more dust than you think...so wipe it down before and after each use... just builds up a charge I guess?
4. After almost two months it started to squeal. This is where Instructions would have ben nice.
The belt was not off center so that wasn't it.
Put her on her side undid her screws to get to motor. Omg dusty from all the dirt it sucked in and yeah the little belt was making a sound. Now don't be like me and put a drop or two of lube on the belt to fix it.....doing so just made the belt slip and the machine not to work. Take a rag and a bit of rubbing alchohol and clean off the two pullies and the belt and that will fix the sound. On any other machine this wouldn't even be noticeable but since she is so quiet you will notice.
5. Small remote easy to lose. Put velcro on it and attach it to machine.
6. Buy treadmill dedicated shoes.
7. It runs hot....you will feel heat....guessing thats normal?
8. Nothing to tell you how tight your belts should be.... im still not sure if I've over tightened mine.
9. No online help....."
"My original post got erased so here's the gyst of it:
Lightweight at around100lbs, comes mostly assembled save for the arms/phone holder. If you install the arms the machine won't lay flat which negates the claim it's easy to store, so take that into consideration. Otherwise, assembly is fairly simple.
The track sticks a little at slower speeds, and always sticks if you step too hard on it. So, heavy walkers and stompers will have trouble even if you weigh less than the recommended weight.
The top part has a lever that releases it to lay flat. Mine arrived pretty loose, but it comes with instructions to tighten it. Also comes with lubricant for routine belt maintenance.
The instructions are written In some semi broken English. Easy to read but very matter of fact and lacking in details.
The remote only works when it feels like it, and since it's the only way to control the settings it is quite annoying. I usually set it at a brisk walk and step off to turn it off because you have to constantly fight the machine to acknowledge the remote.
Good for the quarantine, a little less than I'd expect for a $500 piece of equipment. Probably closer to $350 in pre-quarantine value. Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with my purchase though. Its hurricane season in my state and between the heat, humidity, bugs, and my state's spiking Covid numbers, there's not a lot of options for me to get out to walk/run so I'm happy to have this."
Do not buy this treadmill because it is made cheap and the customer service is horrible. Purchased the treadmill in December 2019 and encountered 3 problems. The belt skips, the remote doesn't work properly, and customer service won't help. The belt makes you feel off balance and can cause you to fall. The remote doesn't make contact with the treadmill consistently. Customer service goes in circles trying to discourage you from contacting them, leaving you with no resolution. What's making matters worse is at this time Amazon is not taking calls and this is difficult to explain in the chat. I would avoid this treadmill and look for another.
"Pros - doesn't take much space. Was fairly easy to put together. Contained all parts and tools to put together. Came assembled except for hand bars.
Cons - keep the manual, you will need it. I had to learn how to adjust the belt right off the bat. It was tracking to the left, rubbing, and not centered as it should be. Another thing I don't care for is having to use a remote to start and adjust speed of the treadmill. I worry that I will drop it while working out and render the treadmill inoperable.
Overall, the price was right and as long as it works I am satisfied.
Please note, you will need a 20 amp plug in."
"This treadmill is awesome! I have a standing desk and while standing is great, I just am not finding the time or motivation to go out and exercise lately. This treadmill works great under my desk, and when I'm not working my wife can raise my desk a bit higher, put the arm up and she can run on it at high speed (arm down it goes from 0.1 to 4 mph, with the arm up it goes from 0.1 to 12 mph).
I teach online classes from my desk and I walk at 1.7 mph while teaching. The feedback was that they can't hear the treadmill, but they can hear my heavy breathing. Hopefully that will improve over time as I get more in shape.
The only con is it doesn't remember your stats, meaning it only tracks distance, time and calories burned while it is on. If you turn it off to go to the bathroom, your distance, time and calorie data is gone. I've gotten in the habit of looking at my distance before turning it off. But, really, in my opinion the distance, time and calories burned is irrelevant. Losing weight and gaining life is what matters to me.
It's a bit heavy, so I don't recommend moving it from room to room, but it's easy enough to move within a room.
I've been teaching this morning so far for 2-hours and 22 minutes as I write this review. I've already walked 2.45 miles.
Great value for the price! Great product!"
Incredibly disappointed. Purchased Goplus 2 in 1 folding treadmill. Set it up and immediately turns on with error message when trying to get it to run. I haven't even had a chance to use it , was brand new. Very hard to get in contact with any of the help line. Trying to figure out how to return it. Don't waste your money.
The product came well packed no damage right out of the box runs great I gave it four stars because I've only had it for less than a week and I'll update it later. I do recommend this product to anyone.
"So this item does not work as described. The speed information is off. When walking on the treadmill, the speed displayed is slower that the actual speed of the individual. At 6 mph according to the treadmill, I could easily walk and talk. On a normal treadmill at the gym, I cannot run 6 mph let alone run. So I synced my smart watch to measure the speed, and my smart watch said that I was only walking at 4 mph when the treadmill said I was walking at 6 mph. So I tried to return it. Customer service is not helpful at all. I had to make a video to prove to them that this does not work. They asked me to send it to an email not affiliated with or through amazon. They asked if I had the original box, which I didn't and told them so. They finally sent me a return label and told me I had to find my own box. To find a box with the approximate dimensions of 54x28x4 is impossible, making it impossible for me to send this item back without incurring significant fees for Fedex to pack the item up to send it back and for me to receive my refund, which won't happen until they get the item back. I believe this is done to keep your money. There is also a language barrier as they are not native English speakers. I am not sure if that is why the customer service is not good as they do not understand what I am writing to them or in what they are writing to me making it hard for me to understand them.
Also, he treadmill is also too small, not the size for a tall person at all. The belt slips as you are walking. You need to keep an eye on your feet as you walk on this to make sure you don't hit the front or the sides or you can easily fall off this."
This is the machine I have been looking for a long time. It does what I want, by showing the time I have been using it as well as calories supposedly used. I have a blue one and it fits in well in my home. If I ever need to put it away, i will need to take off the 2 hand bars and it will slide under my bed. I wish there was a way to fold them without taking them off. Yes,it does not have a lot of fancy bells and whistles, but it is just right for me. You will need to think about your stride if you are very tall, because the machine is shorter than many. The price was excellent, and ILOVE IT! I hVe not connected my iPhone to it yet, so cannot judge this amenity.
"So far i am extremely happy with this product. I wanted something that would be easy to move around in case I wasn't sure which room I wanted it in and something small enough that it wouldn't take up the majority of any room. This is somewhat compact but still has the strength to work with me and my other half (who is well over 200lbs).
This machine compared to the last one I had at home is extremely quite which was another huge plus for me since my workout room is upstairs above an office room. Even at a higher speed no one knew I was workout out.
It doesn't have a place to put water bottles but because it's so compact I've been able to put a little foldable table in front of it or beside it to hold all kinds of stuff. Remotes, phones, water..."
Lo compre en diciembre y lo he ocupado solo algunas veces, lamentablemente no agarra el control remoto como deberÃ­a o tal vez la caminadora , ni con vateria nueva aveces quiere funcionar ya he tratado diferentes marcas de vateria para el control remoto pero sigue sin funcionar correctamente con suerte algunas veces ha prendido pero cuando quiero subir la velocidad no agarra y cuando si sube la velocidad y por un rato logro caminar en ella como que otra vez ya no agarra el control remoto y tengo que dar un brinco para bajar de ella .... principio contacte al vendedor y me dijo que si podÃ­a conseguir un nuevo control remoto me reembolsariaan $25 dÃ³lares, y busquÃ© en la.pÃ¡gina a la que me dirigieron para comprarlo y no se puede conseguir esta descontinuado y al parecer es la Ãºnica forma de encender la caminadora....estoy sÃºper decepcionado de esta compra pues no funciona como deberÃ­a no se si sea el problema con el control remoto o con la caminadora la cosa es que no recomiendo este producto....
This treadmill is great if you don't have a lot of open space. It runs well and is really cute too. We love the fact that the handle bar can be folded down, so if you don't want the bars on the side you can just fold it down. It's a great feature. If I could change one thing it would be so that the screen showed the end result of your walk/run when you stopped.
"I've had this treadmill for about a month now and have used it almost daily. I'll try to be thorough in this review as I wish I had some of this information before purchasing.
Size and look:
Pros - It's thin enough to fit under a taller bed. The fold-down feature is great and the handles are removable. The color is exactly as advertised and the plastic coverings are smooth.
Cons - The handles must be attached/unattached with screws (included), which makes it annoying to store it daily, if that's your goal. The powe cable is very short and I've had to use an extension to place it where I want it.
Function and use:
Pros - The option to walk without the handles being upright (up to 4 MPHs) is a nice feature. The emergency magnet seems to work well and the speed maximum is great for a run. The remote control is efficient and the cell phone holder is pretty strong. There is one ON/OFF switch at the bottom of the machine that gives you extra control. It handles being run on pretty well and hasn't given me any issues as far as a workout.
Cons - The locking mechanism once the bar is raised is not very sturdy. It does the job, but as you walk/run, it wobbles a bit back and forth. The lack of a cup holder or hook area for a water bottle is frustrating. I didn't expect to be bothered by it, but it would be nice to be able to have that capability built-in. The only way to control the speed is through the remote control, but there's no place to put it, so you have to keep a close eye on it. I've used a rubber band to fasten it to the handles.
Biggest con for me was the claim that the machine is ""quiet."" While the motor is not loud, the beeping the machine makes as the speed is turned up or down is very sharp. There's no way to silence this and if you're trying to be thoughtful of others in your home, this won't be very effective. Finally, It's heavier than it seems, so be prepared to get a workout as you move it around your house.
Overall, it does what I need it to do and it's okay for the price, just not very sturdy or well thought out in design."
"I'm issuing a new review because after 6 months the motor failed. I'm giving two stars because at least I got 6 months of good use. The idea behind the treadmill is good. The quality just isn't there. Hopefully, the company will look into a better motor that lasts. I emailed the company about the problem but they just responded with maintenance help (tighten screws, oil it, etc.). If your motor fails, the company isn't willing to guarantee its product with a new one. The first review is still below.
I've owned this treadmill for about 4 months and I use it 4 to 5 times a week for about 10-12 minutes each run. I always run at 10.6kmh which is over 6mph. The treadmill has pros and cons. The price is actually good considering you are paying a slight premium for the miniaturized parts (think laptop vs desktop). It is quiet too. Two things surprised me about it. One, it's solid. I thought that it's light weight might make it bounce around but it doesn't. Two, I thought my feet might hurt since it doesn't have springs underneath it to absorb shock but my feet are still fine 4 months later so that said, this is a real engineered marvel. The built in speaker was easy to sync via my iPad settings. However, I had to de link it because, like clockwork, after running for about 5 minutes, the treadmill Bluetooth would trip my router while streaming -very frustrating. It took a week of this to realize it was my treadmill. That said, the built in speaker is not very good for the audiophile. My iPad speakers are better anyway. I'm not complaining about the built in speaker because if they add two high quality speakers then the price will necessarily jump. Now, my only negative observation is that a cricket-like sound has developed and it keeps getting louder. Maybe I need to lube the treadmill? I've uploaded a video of the sound at 1.5kmh."
"If you are looking for a walking pad, this might be sufficient. However, if you're actually looking for something to run on, think twice before purchasing. The area you can run on is so small, that I have to pay attention to where my feet land all the time when I run, and I have a rather small figure compared to most people. This is probably the biggest complaint I have with this machine. They show you photoshopped images to make you think the machine is larger than it is, but they did label in very small font later in product detail section the actual dimension, which I didn't catch when I was buying it. Truthfully if the belt is a few inches wider, I'm fine with the product as it is and can totally tolerate the other flaws for the price I pay for it.
The product claims to be foldable, but you will need tools to assemble/disassemble the handles and the phone holder. There seems to be some fitting issues for the screws, and I have to use my own electric screw driver instead of the tools they provide to put all the screws in. The phone holder is too small for my iPhoneX, or probably most of the newer phones, so I just never put it on.
The remote is fine, but you need to hold it in your hand at all time when you run. There's no other reachable button for you to stop the machine. If you do not have your remote in hand, the only thing you can do to get off is just jump off the machine, which is definitely not the safest thing to do!
I tried to return it and contacted the customer service, but unfortunately I already threw away the original packaging and they do not accept returns without it. I also learned that even if I have the original packaging, they will charge me $60 for the shipping. It's NOT a prime product, so be aware if you are not buying with absolute certainty to keep it.
Some of the good things about this product. It does function fine as a treadmill and goes up to pretty high speed. It's not too noisy. The Bluetooth speaker works pretty good, which is actually one of the reason I bought this treadmill against many other options on Amazon. Treadmills are expensive; at this price range, whatever you get will have some problems you have to learn to be okay with."
Not even worth for 1 star
PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TREADMILL. Remote failed in less than 3 months. No way to operate the treadmill without remote. $450 for 3 months usage. Most buyers have the same experience after a few weeks of usage. I am reading almost no one has ever been able to get any help or remote replacement from Costway. So you need to writeoff $450 (399+tax+shipping) for a short term usage. I hope Costway reads reviews and responds if they they want to save or continue selling this treadmill. GoPlus is the seller and I don't know if they care to help the buyers.
"Loving this machine. I bought it at the beginning of the quarantine to stay active. It's been a month of daily use. Still working well. Reviews were very helpful when I chose this machine so here are my thoughts:
- Running belt size. I wasn't sure if the length was long enough. 40 inches is much shorter than commercial gym size treadmills. For fast-paced walking, this treadmill is perfect. When I pick up speed to a brisk jogging pace, it's still manageable and fine although extra width and length would make it more comfortable. I am 5'4"". My husband who is 5'10"" uses this treadmill for 5-10 minutes at a time. He says he has to run with accurate precision to feel like he is not falling off. This treadmill was a purchase for me (and not him! haha). I asked if he wanted to change treadmills and he says it's fine but I'm sure given a choice he'd prefer something with a longer running belt.
- Incline. I wanted a flat surface to walk/run on to minimize bulking up the leg muscles. This machine has zero incline so that was just fine for me.
- Clock / Distance / Calories: This machine seems off to me. At my gym, I normally walk at 4.0 miles per hour. I have to walk at 5.2 mph on this machine to feel like it's the same pace. I also run at 6.0 mph at the gym but feel like I need to run at 10.2 mph to achieve the same pace on this treadmill. Calories is definitely wrong. I know I usually burn more than 150 calories when I walk or run for 60 minutes. But all this is ok to me. I don't need accurate calorie count or pace. I just need something to keep my body moving. The timer is correct at least!
- Setup: So easy. I opened the box, lifted the handle bar, plugged in the machine and voila.
- Price / value: I paid $399 in May 2020 and I noticed the price has gone up slightly. This machine was a good value to me. Slim, sleek and worth the money.
- Handle bar: I don't really use it at all. It does come with a smart phone holder, but you can only view your phone in the horizontal / landscape position. It's fine to me since I don't use it. I do wish it came with a water bottle holder. I end up keeping my water bottle on a nearby desk. I also usually just watch things on my laptop which is also on the desk, so I really don't use the phone holder at all.
- Remote control: If you lose the remote, I'm not sure how you would control the speed. I don't remember if this treadmill can hook up to bluetooth. I never looked into it. The remote works fine for the most part. There was a day when it wasn't responding so well and I changed the battery. No issues since.
- Maintenance: So far no issues to report. The product comes with a bottle of lubrication. They recommend lubricating the running belt once in a while to make sure it performs as well as it should. Seems easy enough. Just a matter of placing a few drops of oil under the belt and let it run for a bit. Haven't done it yet so hope it's that simple."
Product arrived on time, even thought UPS had complications they made their efforts and got on time. The product runs smoothly and pretty easy to put it together. I'll be using the machine first time, so I'll will keep you up dated, but so far I am in love with it. May 19, 2020 update: The treadmill continues running smoothly. I have not gotten any issues with it. Now I am convince that it is a great machine with lots of benefits and easy to stored under the bed. I love it. ðŸ‘
it arrived fast! I just want to add: do not try messing with the treadmill mat, just yet. Just loosen the bolts until the mat is loose to oil it up. Then make sure you count how many times you lefty Lucy and Righty tighty, to make sure it even on Both sides. Also the screws are a bit hard to fit when putting the handles up. The Eo7 will come up if you do not place the red magnet in its place. Then you can restart & try again. You have to push the power button twice for the belt to start. I took this for a spin at 7.8 for 30 minutes and held up just fine. I'm waiting on shock absorbing mats so I can use this more often without disturbing my neighbors in my tiny apartment. It's a good size and it does the job, so FAR.
"Goplus 2 in 1 Folding Treadmill, 2.25HP arrived this week (10/2020) and after initial use, it works perfectly. Fits under my desk (sit/stand) and I walked yesterday for 40 minutes while working on the computer, (intended to walk about ~20 minutes). I raised the handle bar and walked a faster pace for 25 minutes. I tested at top speed and expect it to handle it well. I'll need to work up to that for a better test.
I'm 255lbs, held my weight fine. I recommend a little lube, which was included. Distance and speed are in kilometers, but I expect I'll get used to the conversion. The goal is for me to move more often during my 12 hour shift at home.
If this is helpful and you would like an update, let me know."
"WARNING DON'T BUY!
Without the remote it is useless. My remote stopped working its been over a month and they cant replace the remote. So now it's just still here collecting dust. Ridiculous! Its doesnt look like you can even find a universal for it! Not happy.
Update: Costsway sent me a return label to send it back for a refund. They, I must say are easy to work with. It's to bad the manufacturer didnt think ahead regarding the remote since its the only source that makes it work. ðŸ˜‘"
"Cons
- Speed can only be controlled via IR remote, there are no controls on the treadmill itself. Hope you don't lose the remote, or it will be a pricey paperweight. I plan to see if our learning remote can learn the treadmill's control functions so I can safely store the original remote away. ""WITH BLUETOOTH SPEAKER, PHONE HOLDER & REMOTE CONTROL"" in the listing led me to assume a phone app could control the speed, but the treadmill's only a BT speaker, there's no app to control it.
- The black plastic arms DO NOT fold with the silver handrail. They have to be installed or removed with a screwdriver, the ""Lightweight and Foldable Design"" photo was misleading here.
- Off gassing rubber smell when you unpack it, had to open some windows in the room. Hope it goes away with time.
- At slower (walking) speeds, the tread feels like it slips forward a bit as my heel hits it before it resumes motion through the rest of the stride. A little bit worrying, but when jogging at a higher speed I didn't notice the same issue.
Pros
+ Low profile for use under the sit/stand desk and for storage.
+ A little heavy but can roll on the wheels on the front of the unit."
"With the gyms closing, needed a treadmill. This one had an under desk feature that, at the time, was important, but as it turns out I can no longer walk and chew gum (work on my computer).
Out of the box, everything looked fine. I only had to install the arms. And that is a bitch. The screws needed to be threaded through two metal plates in the vertical posts. The screws are barely long enough to reach the other side and kept missing the hole in the second plate. Then getting the screw in the nut on the arm was the next issue. The arm needed to be up against the upright post so there was no way to visually align the screws. Perhaps the screws could be longer as they screw into a hollow arm. And, by the way, to completely lower the upright post for under desk use, the arms had to be removed.
When in use for more than 30 or 40 minutes, it seams the motor gets a bit warm. I have placed a couple of fans forcing air underneath the motor. The motor and treadmill seems to hold up, though. I have had several 60 minute runs and one 150 minute run without any slippage.
The electronics are a problem. First the speaker stopped working and now the Bluetooth doesn't work. The speaker and Bluetooth weren't very important as I have much better sound equipment in my office. Just recently, however, the time, distance, and calories counters started acting erratically. Sometimes they just stop incrementing. I base my workout on my smart watch but it is handy to use the treadmill display.
And finally, customer support is non existent. This same machine is sold under several names and i have no clue who makes it. The box had one name on it but they are just a sales organization selling many things. And the documentation is shoddy at best.
It was less expensive than other treadmills but I would not buy again. I only hope it last until the gyms open again.
I need to revise my review. The motor finally burned out and I had to return it. At first I was a little frustrated since it wasn't clear how to contact support. I learned Costway is the brand and the company is GoPlus. There is a non working phone number for Costway but there is a good number for GoPlus, (+19094831200). Once I did contact them, they were a real pleasure to work with. They sent me a return UPS label, arranged for a pickup and issued a full refund.
The treadmill is good for walking and light jogging but had trouble with one to two hour runs."
Doesn't work! The only way to get this work it seems is with the remote and my remote doesn't work and I'm so pissed! It's heavy as hell and after damn near throwing out my back to get it upstairs the damn thing won't work. I even went out at 11pm to get a new battery, determined to get it to work and nothing! I'm so pissed!
"Nice little bedroom treadmill. Great for general or under-desk use. Specifically, I like it for walking at about 4.0km. There's a little bit of hassle moving it around, especially if you keep a rubber mat under it, and moving the railing around is a little stiff (the handle that controls the rail moving mechanism is stiff and doesn't lock easily). Attaching the handles to the rail (optional) is a pain, especially if you want to take them off, since once they're on you can't really fold the treadmill anymore. But it makes up for the problem by being quiet. It's a good volume, safe for apartment use. I don't use it to Run at my weight (aprx 245) the mat slips and stalls a little bit. Nothing major.
** The treadmill came broken?!!!!! Because of the pandemic situation, I didn't want an exchange. The company helped me hire someone to fix it. Luckily, my super is a mechanic and was able to repair it for $50. Now it's fine. Overall, highly recommended at the $400 price Point for anyone who wants to walk while watching tv or doing computer work. As for running? Maybe if you're 220lbs or lighter."
I bought this treadmill and have been using it every day, an hour a day since i received it. It was working great for a walking pace of 3.5. Two weeks in, I went up to 5 and the motor stopped working. I am currently trying to get in contact with the company that sells the treadmill. However, they only have an email, no phone number. It takes a day or two for them to respond. They offered to replace the product but recanted because i do not have the original box. They have offered to reimburse service fees if i find a technician to fix it. I am going on week 3 now of owning the product and one of the weeks is dealing with their "customer service." Also they advertised the motor to be 2.5hp but it is really a .75hp.
"What you must know
1. Not easy to store if you fully assemble
2. Works fine
3. no incline possible
4. Sleek
5. Requires remote to work!
6. No room for iPad during run
7. E07- you can fix with a reset- pull off emergrency stop a few times
8. Very short cord- likely need extension unless next to plug
9. Belt resistance can give a bit when you step down- be careful
10. Very quiet after one loud beep to turn on.
We have had the treadmill for less than a month but everyone in the family loved it. This was to replace a very expensive treadmill that we've had for 20 years and is finally giving up on us. We cannot get it out of the incline and I refuse to do all my workouts in incline. So we bought this because I have become sedentary without it and working from home due to Covid. Plan was to put it under my desk so that I could walk during some of my meetings as I have done with the old treadmill. But this treadmill is so user-friendly that the entire family wanted to use it and it's currently in our playroom.
This morning I woke up to get on the treadmill before dawn only to see an error message E07 and I couldn't get the treadmill to work the remote control would not work. So I came online to see if anyone else had had the same problem and began to freak out as I saw the review that talked about having this error message and getting little to no help from customer service. Having just bought a bike that only has one functioning pedal but good customer service planning to help I really couldn't have two pieces of exercise equipment that were non-functional and no boxes to return anything.
This piece of equipment was incredibly easy to put together and has been a good and useful product. You should note that you cannot lose the remote control because if you do your treadmill is just an expensive clothing hanger. There should definitely be an alternative to using the remote.
I did not take a picture of the EO7 message since I thought I had time. I assumed it would remain and this would be a dispute with customer service and request for a refund. However, I took out the magnetic pin that stops the treadmill, placed it back on and off again and suddenly the treadmill reset.
This treadmill is a bit of a gamble I've also only had it for a month I will continue to update. But if you get the E07 message all hope is not lost!"
"My basic take is that this treadmill works fine. It does what it's supposed to do. It does not have exciting features, but neither does it have any major flaws.
That said, it has a number of minor flaws that may or may not be important to you. You should be aware of them before you decide to buy.
* The English version of the setup and operating instructions are apparently ""Google translated"" from some other language. They are not easy to follow.
* Setup involves attaching the handholds. In order to do this, you have to thread four long black bolts through the back of the black frame and into the holes in the handholds. You can't see what you're doing, and if you get the angle wrong you will miss the holes. It took me many tries to get this right.
* The photos indicate that you can fold the treadmill flat and store it underneath a piece of furniture. This is true only if the handholds are removed. As noted above, removing and replacing the hand rests is not something you can do in a few seconds. You can fold the frame down so that the ends of the handholds are on the floor, but it will not fit under furniture. The alternative is to not install the handholds and risk losing your balance.
* The Bluetooth speakers work fine, but the remote has no volume control. You have to control volume from your phone, computer, TV, etc. If you can't reach that while running the treadmill, you have to make sure it's set properly before you start--taking into account the noise of the treadmill itself.
* The digital display shows speed and distance in kilometers only. If you want miles, you will have to do the conversion yourself."
"Horrible design and doesn't work as described. Frame had manufacturing defects. I threw out my box after purchase, thinking this was gonna be an amazing buy since I work from home but this was not what I expected and was the worst buy ever.
I actually ended up spending more on a new one just have this mistake over with and rectified.
1. The track is way too narrow.
2. When you walk on it the pad slips forward a bit with ever single step.
3. It's loud when you walk on it! (Not lk description)
4. Manufacturing defects on the underside of the machine and chipped paint. The plastic is broken where it clearly just should have been cut but I guess they figured it didn't matter because he who cares about the bottom. Anyway I don't wanna waste too much more of your time on this review. Basically, since purchased almost a month ago, I've gotten enough use out of it to know that it's not gonna last long term and I don't want to end up with an injury from the track slipping forward when I'm on the machine... oh and lastly smh... you can attach the bars but if you do it won't fold completely flat anymore so you can't access the walk only feature that only allows you to put the machine between 0.5-4.0mph. With the bar raised, you can go 12mph!!!! The track is simply just way to small for that speed!!! So I was faced with a dilemma... attach the bars and forfeit being able to access the 4.0 mph max OR leave it up and deal with possibly flying off into the wall by accidentally hitting 12mph! Also, machine has no controls other than the remote! Just horrible all around."
Received this treadmill yesterday seems to be just what I need for the small space that we have I originally had had a question about how to connect the Bluetooth but I figured that one out when you open your Bluetooth app it comes up with media and that's what it connects to the only thing I think I would have changed on this is a way for the handles to fold up and click into a lock position and then push a button to unlock and fold down next to the riser so you can fold the entire thing down rather than have to remove the handles in order to fold it flat . all in all I am looking forward to using this daily to get rid of the extra weight that I have put on over the last year or two I hope that it continues to work
"This product should be for small kids
Motor is very week for adult users
I will not recommend this product."
"I just received this. The box was very banged up when it arrived. I took photos and send to the seller/shipper just in case it was damaged. When I opened the box the treadmill appeared to be ok. I set it up and am using it as I type this review.
Compared to Life Fitness treadmill that died after 5 years of use, this treadmill is not as robust/sturdy and the movement is jerky. Not smooth walking or running. It feels like there is a hesitation each time a foot hits the belt.
Other than that it seems to be ok. Reading all the other reviews about damage in shipping does not surprise me."
I've owned many treadmills and they are always so big and bulky. I love the size of this machine. It's tiny and perfect for a small person (5 5 115lbs). However, after only one month and less than 80 miles I noticed a burning smell. I immediately stopped using it and contacted the manufacturer. Upon investigation I noticed melted plastic coming from the motor. See pic. By the way, the motor is 0.75 Horsepower NOT 2.25 as stated in the description. Anyway, the company refunded me after I almost broke my back getting it down a flight of stairs and back into the original packaging. KEEP THE BOX! Maybe I got a lemon? I don't know. But I'd pay top dollar for a lightweight/compact treadmill like this that actually worked and wasn't a fire hazard. This company needs better quality control.
"Pro: It is pretty easy to fold. A good size for a small space. It looks sleek and has an easy to read screen.
Cons: The biggest con is it pops the circuits in my house. We have standard 15volt plugs. This needs 20. And it didn't specify that in its details. I have to run a huge extension cord across my house to use the one plug it will work in. Very inconvenient. The belt is not smooth and keeps jerking. Also, the speed is not true speed. At the gym I usually fast walk at 4, on this treadmill a 4 is barely a stroll so I won't be able to ever keep the rails down. And it's not really that quiet, definitely not as advertised.
The instructions are also very confusing.
I won't return it because it will be a pain in the behind and it will serve it's purpose to let me walk. Basically I would say skip this purchase. I'm pretty disappointed."
"I am happy to report that this device is easy as heck to install, and quick to working out. Within 30 minutes I had this plugged in and working. Seriously. The device is that simple. Below I listed the pros and cons of what the device has.
Pros:
1.Within an hour of reading instructions, understanding the screws and parts, you'll be up and walking in NO time. I was really surprised how an over thinking male such as myself really made this a simple set up.
2. Q U I E T. I live in a house hold with family, and I was able to leave my bedroom door open, movie playing and this device running and nobody woke up. Most devices sell their features in a tag, but when they say quiet, they really mean it with this product.
3. Bluetooth feature really makes this prime for anyone who enjoys a movie or music with their device. I wouldn't doubt for a minute that you'll be using this if you don't have a lap top, PC, cellphone or television.
4. The price is remarkable for what you're now able to do in a small space, AND not spend money on gas. This also allows the user to cook at home, and not test their will power to pull over for a quick, fast-food fix. Already winning!
Cons:
1. Package is heavy as heck. You may need a friend to carry this mother flipper in.
2. For safety and assurance reasons, the lock tight feature for raising the bar is somewhat difficult. I only mention this for the elderly women who might not have the upper strength to lock this into place, or like I previously mentioned, need assistance in carrying this package indoors. I am sorry if this is offensive in advance.
3. I'm not a gym expert, and you should take that for consideration for when I mention this. But I believe the walk-pad is slightly toooooo narrow for those that are wide and 6'4. I only say that because the device can only hold a certain weight limit, and for anyone who's just a big person (not overweight) that this device may not fit you're build. Once again, I am not an expert, and should take this as a warning for anyone that's stocky."
So, I originally hated this treadmill and had given it a 1 star review. When I first plugged it in , I got an E07 error message - which, when googled, said I needed to replace the console. But, after some searching, just found that it was due to me not putting the safety magnet in place. The treadmill will not start without the safety being on... so ok, cool. That being said, I read past reviews and decided to check that the treadmill was lubricated. It was not. So I did that. All went OK. So, after all the initial issues, it actually turned out really nice. It was easy to set up, looks really nice, it's a bit heavy, but movable on my carpet. I like it. I'm just not giving 5 stars due to the initial set up problems. One issue was my fault, but the lubricating is not something listed on the "before you start" part of the manual.
"I had some drama with this treadmill initially which wasn't the seller's fault. FedEx lost it and I had to get in touch with the seller to figure out next steps. I contacted the seller through Amazon and they were quick to respond within 24 hours. They opened an investigation with FedEx and shipped me another one.
Then the day before I got the new one, the lost package managed to arrive with the box all busted up so I let the seller know and they provided a return label to send it back. Very pleasant experience with the seller. Now on to the treadmill.
I had another treadmill that was larger and took up space in my small bedroom. I didn't like that it took up so much space or that it made so much noise when I walked on it because it would wake up my daughter in the mornings. So over time, it became a clothes hanger before I ended up giving it away just to make room. I always thought, if there was a smaller option available, I would go for that.
Then I discovered this treadmill. So the first thing I noticed is that the belt needed to have oil placed under it. Otherwise, it sticks. The weight limit is 265 on it and I am exactly that weight. So I added oil (which was included) under the belt and it worked perfectly. There are times where it sticks a little but not so much that it affects my balance or makes me feel like I'm going to get injured.
I've had it less than a month but I use it an hour a day, twice a day on 3.2 with the bar down. Works perfectly. And it's surprisingly SUPER quiet. I can close my bedroom door and my daughters and walk on it without her hearing a thing. In the afternoons, I use the bluetooth speaker to listen to podcasts and although it's not an amazing speaker, the sound quality is good.
I don't have any complaints about this treadmill and so far, it's been working as advertised. The only thing I wish is that the phone holder was a llittle closer because if I raise the bar, I can't place my phone on it unless I have a headphone extender cord. I'd have to walk super close to the motor or front of the belt and I've noticed at my weight, the closer I am to that area, the more skipping I get. So I try to stay closer to the middle of the belt.
Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase."
I've had this treadmill for six months. I do slow to very fast walking. The price was good and I was able to set up the treadmill on my own (because of COVID fears I didn't want workmen in my apartment). Overall, it's a fairly good treadmill, however, there is an issue that is driving me to insanity and I'm at the point of trashing the treadmill and buying a more expensive one FROM A DIFFERENT VENDOR AND MANUFACTURER! The built in bluetooth has no controls. It has no passwords. Anyone nearby can unknowingly connect to it and in particular some of my neighborhood kids play their video games and the sounds come blaring through the treadmill speaker. I've tried to connect my own device as others have suggested, but if the neighbors have (unknowingly) connected first, there is no way to gain control of the blue tooth. It just plays at full volume and it is impossible to work out with that blaring at me. I contacted the seller/manufacturer and they say there is no control to it and that you're supposed to use your own device to control it. I just plain give up! Trash Heap!
"Don't make the mistake and purchase this item. The item arrived this evening, damaged and tools are not suitable to assemble. The language in the manual is poorly worded- not standard English. Opened box and corner of treadmill is broken off from the base. The adjustment for handler bar was difficult to put together, tools weren't appropriate for this task.The tools provided were at best substandard making it almost impossible to assemble.
Please do not buy from this company!!!"
Pulled into driveway seeing guy finishing up the delivery was a huge fedex truck taking up the whole driveway. Walked up to see first thing a huge hole in the box. Should of taken a pic myself that very moment. Delivery was late so the install I paid for to set it up had to be cancelled until a later date like 3 weeks later. Figured i better open see the damage and see if its bad. Should of just returned it immediately that day while it was still in the box. I was naively hopeful so that i could begin getting out of the covid cabin fever right? Wrong. Opened to first see a huge crease in the belt, again remaining hopeful that it was all going to be ok because its brand new right? Wrong. Get it all assembled and find two other places there is visible damage. Not what i paid for. I like how this delivery guy happened to not take a pic of the dropoff like all the other amazon deliverys i got, i wonder why? So i start it up and its jerking me and slipping. Look at the owners manual and these people are clearly foreigners or very uneducated stumbling thru the instruction process. Head scratcher, props to you if you are able to understand it. They also conveniently included a picture in the manual that is dark and hard to make out what it is. Better off drawing a picture at this point. Thought this is a joke right? Oh well whatever. Makes zero sense so like anyone else i went to youtube. Thank you YOUTUBERS!! Adjusted the belt and applied some oil....nothing! Still slipping and jerking me around. Bit of a $600 gamble with expert install that was purchased that got put off 3 weeks later because it was not delivered on time! Ugh! Then it gets worse as i start scrolling thru the amazon Q n A comments section reading many people having the same issue as me or other kinds or other problems being stuck with the machine. Waste of time, money, energy, and my life at this point. Best of luck to those who purchase may yours be in good working order. Mine was not.
This product is garbage. The bolts to put the arm rests together don't fit. The belt doesn't stay on the track, so it is effectively useless. The Bluetooth doesn't work.
Doesn't work!! Belt randomly stopped a few times mid workout (so dangerous!) and now it has stopped working completely. I tried being nice and contacting the seller directly about the issue and they told me I can take the treadmill to the closest FedEx.. I already told them I no longer had the box, it likely won't fit in my car, nor can I transport this heavy treadmill by myself!! I suggested a replacement be sent to me so I can use that box to send the broken treadmill out but that suggestion got ignored in two separate emails. And to add insult to injury, they told me I'd get $20 off the sale price if I decided I want to keep it.. HA! Don't waste your time and money here.. I tried finding a solution but I'll likely end up disputing my charges and throwing this junk in the trash.
Because my local gym was closed on and off since March, I wanted to find a more permanent cardio solution for home. I already own a standing desk so this was super easy to fit under and use while I work. It also goes up to an 8 min/mile time so good for running, too (unfortunately not sprinting speeds though). I didn't add the arms because I wanted to be able to fold the front bar--and honestly I don't really miss the bars because it's not going insanely fast anyway. You may consider foam mats underneath the treadmill to preserve your wooden floors (I've had a couple scratches when I was first moving it around). Otherwise, I move it in and out of my desk area daily to make room for my chair and while it is a tad heavy, the wheels make it easy to maneuver. Haven't tried the bluetooth feature because I'm usually listening to things on my laptop or phone using earphones. I wish it was quieter at fast walking/running speeds, but honestly that's to be expected from any treadmill to be honest. I'm happy with this purchase and think it would suit anyone who is trying to walk while work/watching tv or do moderate running.
The customer service is excellent, my remote is not very sensitive and contact the customer service they immediately shipped me a new remote. However the machine has a hesitation problem, when i step on the belt seems it slightly slip first then catch up on my pace. The problem occurred after I did not use it for two months. I put some lubricant that is shipped with the machine under the belt, It helps some how. For me I always holding the handle bar when I use it so that does not border me too much. Sorry, I can only give two stars.
"This treadmill fits our needs and lifestyle. It's size makes it able to store under a bed when guests come and we need the bedroom for a bedroom. That said, I do need to say the two arms that stick out for you to hold on to must be unscrewed and removed to fold the unit flat. When those are off the treadmill is about 6"" thick.
So far, it has been running well. We haven't tried to flat out run on it, more like fast walking speeds. It's great to as I said, go for a walk. Ours is set up by a T.V. so we can watch a show or two, and not think about walking for ""exercise"". If you're trying to be an olympic athlete, get yourself a more expensive model that inclines and all that.
But for us, this is great when we can't get outside for a walk, due to time or weather.
It was easy enough to assemble and set up. The tiny remote control ,as others may say, is easily misplaced, so I put some velcro on it so it sticks on the main front beam, and stays there. I don't trust the ""calories burned"" numbers on here, or on most any machine, they are just there to motivate? you or whatever. As long as you are moving, and healthy, that's what counts."
With the gyms being closed during this COVID-19 pandemic, I needed to find alternative ways to get my exercise in. Brisk walks outside were fine until the weather got hot and I'm not one to go walking in 100+ degree weather so I looked into getting a small treadmill. Found this one and decided to give it a try based on the good reviews. It works as advertised, but there are a few things that I would like to point out. First off the "instruction manual" may as well be written in martian. It looks like it was slapped together via a bad Google translate session rendering it completely useless. After attempting to read it, I was more confused and had a monster headache. Skip it to save yourself the headache, or if you feel like reading something comedic, read the "warnings" section. There are some gems in that section. Aside from the poorly written manual, the unit itself works as intended, BUT, be forewarned, if you are expecting the equipment to be similar to one you've used at your local gym, it won't be. The belt is much more tense than I'm used to, making it harder to walk on even at higher speeds. I feel like I'm constantly walking uphill because of the tension. I can deal with that, I figure my legs will come out more toned and once I'm able to go back to the gym, the treadmill there will be even easier to use and I can up my speed on it. My other concern is that the "riser" bar is basically useless. In full position, it is too far forward to be able to grip it while walking or even place my cell phone on it. I don't' care about the cell phone, but when walking at higher speeds I like to grip the side bars to ensure I stay on the belt and stay focused at a steady pace. I ended up setting up the riser bar by wedging it in the back of two of my sofa pieces. It works, the riser bar stays in the position I want it in (more in the middle of the unit) without moving at all. The bluetooth speaker is nice, but don't expect a sound that will blow you away, lol. I'm sticking to my Air Pod Pros for music. Bottom line, the treadmill works as advertised, it gets the job done for now.
At $500, this is well worth the price. After researching I went with this one for the high number of reviews it had which averaged out to 4 stars. I almost thought of giving it 4 starts, but it deserves 5 so far. I bought this so I can get some exercise while at work (I run my own business and still go in to the office.) since at home I can't manage to do much because I have little ones. I thought about giving it 4 starts because it was heavy and you shouldn't run (safety) on it because it's very narrow and can trip, but 1. Most treadmills are heavy and 2. I bought this to walk while at work, not run. I did see other machines that had 5 star with a few hundred reviews that were about $300-500. I also saw a very nice one that was very wide for you to move around your desk at a whopping $3k, but then figured if I really need to get something across my desk, walking across my treadmill while holding on to my desk may not be the safest option. All signs pointed to this machine and I went ahead and bought a used standing desk converter on offer up. I manage to walk an average of 8,000 steps or 3.6 miles a day @ 2 mph which isn't too bad for me since I can be on the move at my workplace anyways. An added workout while I do work isn't a bad thing at all. New slimmer healthier me, here I come.
The treadmill itself ok. Good quality and very stable. My worry is the remote control it so fragile and the machine do not work without it. But I am happy with my purchase. Thanks
My only problem was it was delivered damaged but other then that it works great easy to assemble, but it heavy to move.
"I have had this machine for 3/4 weeks now. I have been using everyday for little more than an hour. I walk and run on it. It's small to fit in my townhouse room. It doesn't make noise and disturb my roomies. The only sound heard is my thumping of my feet! It's foldable but the handle isn't that easy enough for me...I need to put little pressure so I leave the bar up.
The functionality of it is very minimal - once you turn on, u can go high or low with your remote. You do have bluetooth connect for music/sound. It has little place to hold you phone or remote.
It's not too sophisticated as gym treadmill but it does the work!
It did come with 2 lubrication bottle. The picture in the manual was not clear but once I looked into youtube I got how I need to lubricate the belt. So far, it's working well and I am very satisfied with the product."
This treadmill is exactly what I was looking for as far as price, functionality, and size. I live in an apartment building on the top floor, so I definitely needed something lightweight that is on the quiet side. It's very easy to assemble and maneuver, and it looks nice. It is perfect to fit under a desk now that I'm working from home. For all of that I give it easily 5 stars. BEWARE, though, that if you are looking for an accurate workout, this is not the treadmill for you. The speed, distance, and calories burned are all WAY off. Having a Fitbit/Apple Watch or equivalent is necessary if you're looking for accuracy. It is also a small treadmill, so if you have long legs like I do, running may not be a great option. As I walk, I graze the back end of the track. All of that being said, I do recommend this treadmill, I just wanted to share my experience because I didn't know or think of any of this before I purchased it.
"I bought this product with the goal of keeping it front of may adjustable height computer desk. After days of walking at it's maximum speed of ""4.0"", which is the max speed when the handle is lowered, it seemed to be too slow. I realized there was no way that I was walking at 4 MPH. After going to my local gym, it became 100% clear to me that this treadmill was far slower than 4 MPH.
My first thought was that I had been cheated with false advertisement by a dishonest company. However, after taking a closer look at the product's description, it does say ""kilometers per hour"". Therefore, it was my mistake.
4 KPM equals 2.49 MPH, which is kind of slow. If you need to go faster, you have to raise the handle, which is not an option for my office setup.
Overall, the product does what the description says it is supposed to do, so I'm giving it 5 stars. It is easy to fold it and put it away, which makes it perfect for my small office.
The instructions are poorly written; it is clear that it was written by people with very broken English. Later, I will have to watch some YouTube videos on how to lubricate it because it is impossible to understand how to do it from the instructions."
I bought this treadmill because I needed something small and quiet to walk on a few times a day just to get my butt off the couch during this pandemic. It's very jerky and sticky at anything under 5 mph. But that's okay, it forces me to walk briskly which is better anyway. It still sticks a bit at higher speeds but you get used to it. I tried running on it and it was fine - it went surprisingly fast. It's not very loud either. It's pretty narrow and short compared with a regular treadmill so you kinda have to pay attention or rest a hand on one of the handles if you're watching TV. I'm 6 feet tall and it worked with my stride. As for aesthetics, it's pretty sleek and modern looking - once you remove all the orange safety stickers plastered everywhere. The belt that came with my treadmill didn't have the awful giant "Superfit" logo printed on it - it's just a plain black belt, thank goodness. Overall, it's a very decent alternative to a full size, expensive treadmill.
"Like most people stuck in the rat race, I work a desk job. That's 8-9 hours five days a week sitting.
Even the most ergonomic chairs still just offer the same thing. Sedentary inactivity.
I've got an EvoDesk that can be sitting or standing, but standing stationary is still not movement (though it's nice to stretch and correct posture)

The secret to Rebel Wilson's dramatic weightloss? WALKING (along with a more mindful diet of course)
.
I've only had my TreadMill a few days.... But I've used it 6 hours a day the last 3 days.
.
My thoughts:
--- Build Quality - It's well built but not super solid. It's plastic. If you have kids or teens that are rough on stuff or are going to be banging their bikes or toys or whatever into it, it's not going to stand up well. Mine did stand up to a trip in a Shipping truck so that says a lot lol. It has a few little scuffs but nothing serious.
--- Weight & unpacking - The unpacking was a bit messy with all the styrafoam and straps etc. The unit isn't super large as we all know. It's not a full size commercial treadmill. It weighs around 85lbs and was easy for me to handle. For context though, I'm a 6' male at 195lbs. I can lift heavier things and have long arms lol. If you're 5'0 and 120lbs you may have more difficulty moving it around.
I do carry it in and out of my office upright when I'm not using it. It does have nice rollers at the front, I just have doorway lips to move it over.
--- Speakers - The bluetooth speakers are not great, but if you don't have your headphones because the dog ate them, they'll do the trick. I didn't realize ""MEdia"" or whatever, was the speakers so I accidentally hooked my MacBook bluetooth to it instead of my google nest lmao. It was surprising I thought, ""Where the hell is the music coming from?? OH it's the treadmill!"". for what the speakers are, I'd give them an 8/10. But they are NOT bose or Sonos so don't get your hopes up. In the context of what they are, they're like laptop speakers.
--- Initial use - I have never used it with the handles up, I probably never will. I got it specifically for walking while I work. I'm walking right now actually at ""3"" which I think is kmg (1.8mph).
LUBE THE TRACK - it doesn't say to, but I would suggest getting a good amount of silicone lube under the track to keep from catching or damaging the tread belt. Sure they can lube these at the factory, but how long have they been sitting in a warehouse??? It's likely the lube is either not effective or isn't enough. You can't really over lube them. I mean if you dump a gallon yes, but if any drips off onto your floor it's a simple cleanup. I didn't have any drippage.
IT COMES WITH LUBE - but I did get an additional bottle that was a suggestion by amazon. I plan on lubing it weekly as I will be using it so much.
.
I got the Error message everyone talks about, it's for not having the emergency clip magnet in its spot. Since I'm not using it with the handle, I unknotted the string and put the red plastic clip directly in its spot. You can see it in the photo, it rests on the inside of the folded handle.
.
Plugged it in, flipped the big orange switch and it came to life. Mine wasn't catching or fraying, but I did slick it up before first use.
.
First day I realized my phone (on my desk) and watch (on my wrist) weren't counting steps. lol of course, because I'm not moving my arms while I walk. They are gyroscopic so google fit, or whatever app you use won't pick up on it. I've since put my SmartWatch face in my sock lmao.
- You can do that with your fitbit too! It's way more accurate tracking leg movement than arm.
.
Anyway Second day (yesterday 12/29/2020) was much better. I walked from 10am to 1pm at ""3"" a normal walk I would say. I had 6400 steps!!! I didn't break a sweat, I didn't have any pain. I did have that wobbly leg feeling when I got off though lolol. Had lunch and sat for about an hour and then walked another 6k steps from 2pm to 5pm. I did notice my non-dominant foot (left) was a little sore; I was waking in socks. Walking in shoes the rest of the day helped that. The top of my left Hamstring was also a little sore, nothing crazy... lower back and butt were a little sore too. Again, nothing crazy. Just felt like they were actually used!
.
12k in change for steps and I felt pretty good about that.
.
The belt does catch a little as you step on it, again, I'm not running on this thing. I doubt it would be a good running treadmill. It's too skinny and, just, if you want a strong running marathon treadmill, save up your money and splurge on that $1200 one you're looking at.
.
All bodies are different, I'm not trying to lose weight or get stronger, or even get better conditioning; I just wanted to move my body instead of sitting all day. There's no ""goal"" here other than moving and I'm doing that.
.
For those who are curious there's plenty of data out there. Walking is good for your body.
People who are overweight or obese will find that walking is easier than cardio (obvi) so it's a good start AND they specifically will see massive changes.
Walking 10k a day at around 200lbs you'd be expecting around losing 1lbs a week.
Couple that with better eating habits and proper portions, you can significantly change your life.
.
It's a good investment, You can find other walking treadmills for around $300; I didn't mind the extra $100 for this one. You can get an EvoDesk for $700. $1,000 may seem like a lot, but realize that this is an investment in yourself. Your health will thank you.
.
I'll update my review if anything changes but right now there are no qualms with it as a great walking treadmill."
Do not buy! Nothing works on this treadmill and you can not get ahold of customer service
"Just got my treadmill today and it is all that the advertisement says! Great compact package that is relatively lightweight for the amount of function it provides. There is a lever that locks the stabilization bar in place which sticks out if not locked by about 4. Of course this is only an issue if you want the ability to move the bar up and down in a small space. Some things to consider:
1. Easy to stall- virtually a plug and play.....for the most part.
2. The safety leash has to be connected In order to work. It must be in place even if the bar is lowered and you are using for the walking function. Not a big deal, just a weird engineering featured- have to secure the string so it doesn't get sucked into the belt while being used on lowered bar.
3. The remote is easy to use- be sure to remove battery sticker to engage. One thing to keep in mind is if the remote goes missing- you've just acquired a 75 lb paper weight/fancy clothes hanger. There is no other way to control the machine. I have secured the remote onto the bar- I have 4 kids and had a paper weight producing scare within 30 minutes of having the new machine!
4.***Not sure if this is right but crossing fingers.....set up instructions don't mention lubricating belt but maintenance instructions mentioned the need. AND the box comes with two bottles of lube. I found instructions on how to lubricate the belt online and got it done....hopefully this prevents any issues resulting in an early death of My new treadmill.
Otherwise it is perfect. So
Glad I purchased."
"So far, so good, easy setup, very high speeds, wish the phone holder expanded enough to hold a tablet. Update......I was able to rest my tablet on phone holder without it falling. Other than that I have not had it long enough to determine durability etc.
I paid a bit more than I wanted to spend but I love it so far and it seems like a solid piece of equipment.
Update: Still haven't had it long but l am actually using it everyday. I do 35 minutes maximum 5.5 speed, so far so good. Its comfortable and quiet, I walked while watching a movie with hubby and there were no issues. The machine is literally right behind our couch, right where he was sitting and we were both able to hear the movie without increasing the volume since the baby was sleeping."
Just recieved item in mail yesterday. Set it up last night, turned it on and it worked just fine. Turn it off, and unplugged it to save energy. Went to use it today, plugged it in, turned it on, and nothing! Plugged into another outlet. Still nothing. Turned it over to see what was wrong. It's a simple device, so there was not much to do. I am very disappointed in this treadmill. I am more upset about how to return it during the COVID!! Pissed and angry over money and time wasted!
"This is decent. I live in an apartment complex that has a gym that's been closed for 2 months, and I don't get outside to walk or run enough these days. I needed to do something. Just got this today. The handles are a pain to install and if you do, you can't fold it anymore. That was the entire point of buying this model... folding/portability. They could have designed the handles to remove easily or fold, too. At least provide longer screws, those short screws are a pain in the ass... you don't want to have to attach those handles more than once. I ended up leaving the handles off.
But the treadmill works, and I can walk or run on it. When running it shakes a bit, and the running area is small. Being 5'4 is about perfect for my running stride if I don't shift too much. I don't like having to hold a remote control to change the settings, but what can you do. Wish it had the option to show mph... and don't think the speed is accurate even when I make the conversion to mph. It seems faster than it should be.
It's heavy but manageable with the wheels. I'm a female. I took a photo while on it to show the walking are is more narrow than all the marketing makes it seem. Still fine.
My main gripe though is they jacked up the price to $529.99 (plus tax) because of current demand. I'd have felt better about all the issues this thing has if I didn't have to pay extra to get it. My understanding is it should closer to $400. In the end, I need the exercise and glad to have it, just wish the quality better matched the cost."
Worse experience on my 100 plus purchases on Amazon DONT BUY IT YOU WILL REGRET IT
"Got this for Christmas and it's been a hassle. It was late getting here. The box was in rough shape.
Once we opened it to put it together we realized if you put the handles on it is no longer flush to store. Also getting the handles on was difficult because the screws would go in all the way.
Read the instructions which clearly was done by google translate. It said to not get it wet to pour water on it.
Tried seeing if the belt needed to be lubed and there was no clear distinction. Belt was also loose and took me and hour just to figure out the adjustments that were also not clear. After all that I had to adjust a few more times since the belt kept moving to the side. The speeds are a joke. I did not try to Bluetooth. I did quickly realize I needed to have the treadmill close to an outlet because the cord is so short. The photos they show of people using it shows them using it without power.
Was going to return it but the seller won't pay for shipping and shipping it back costs almost as much as the machine itself. Tried to find a way to contact seller and no way to contact and Amazon just shift your questions to me mailing them except no email is listed. Once I used the treadmill it was loud and did not run smoothly. I am used to a gym treadmill but didn't think this treadmill would be this bad. Don't buy. Splurge on one that is better!"
"READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY! THIS COULD SAVE YOU $450!!!!! - REVIEWS ARE MISLEADING!!!
Normally, I'm a fairly generous reviewer. Most products are decent quality and work as they are advertised. Not this treadmill. First, it showed it was shipped one day after order then it sat for a week in their warehouse before actually shipped. Then it took the snail's route to arrive and I'm only one state away so that was disappointing. Once it arrived, I immediately took it out of the box and it was beautiful and easy to assemble. I oiled the tread then... nothing. The remote wouldn't connect. It took me 30 mins of trial and error (the instructions are written by someone that does not speak English as their first language), before I was able to get the remote to identify. FINALLY, I got it working... And it wouldn't go above 1.2KM per hour!!! OMFG?!?!? Really. It never went above that. Kept trying. It would jump .1KM per hour every shutdown/reboot so I finally got it to a grand total of 1.4KM before it just stopped identifying the adjustment completely. 90% of the time, the power on the remote doesn't even work so I have to manually shut it off while it's still running? Yeah, I'm sure that's good for the electronics. Then when I call them this morning (at EXACTLY 9AM PST like their website says) and pressed ""1"" for customer service, I get an answering machine telling me my ""wait time is at least 33 mins"". So I waited... for 60 mins. Nobody answered. I hung up and called back and chose to speak with the operator ""0"" (there are only two options) -- guess what? The operator inbox is FULL?? I had to laugh by this time. So I call customer service again... ""wait time is at least 49 mins"". I stopped laughing and hung up and emailed them. Doubting I'll ever hear back. Honestly, I have a 75 slooooooow very pretty paperweight that isn't gonna do me any good unless this company gets off it's ass and actually creates a working product. Don't buy this product. It's very pretty. And I'm sure there are people with perfectly working machines. But it's like Russian Roullette with your $450 (and your health) investment. I wouldn't buy from them again. Costway Customer service... Get your act together. You don't deserve to be in business if you can't even answer the phone."
We received this treadmill very quickly and set it up in 30 minutes. It has a nice holder to put your phone, great bluetooth speaker, a remote and fairly quiet. It's set up in our one bedroom apartment and my boyfriend and I walk for about 30 minutes a day on it. It's foldable and able to fit under our sofa. Our gym is closed right now due to Coronavirus so we walk on this to stay active. The speaker sounds great, there's calorie, distance and time of workout listed at your feet. Get the treadmill if you have a small place. you'll love it!
"I bought this treadmill to beat the COVID blues. So far, so good. I'm not doing any heavy running on it, just some brisk walking (about an hour to two per day) while watching the Vampire Diaries. The directions are definitely hard to read (as they've been translated from another language), but you get the gist. I would recommend using the lubrication and adjusting the tightness of the running belt during your first use. I noticed my belt was running a little to the right, so I adjusted the tightness of the right side of the belt (can be found in your instruction manual) and it's running perfectly now. I think if you're looking for something small and compact, this is for you.
Note: I didn't attach the arms to the machine, as I haven't needed them yet. I read in other reviews they are hard to assemble. And don't allow the machine to fold flat."
Very convenient to have it at any room in the house. Works very well and it is excellent for walking and jogging. Has helped me to continue my walking routine at home during this pandemic.
So i got this since my gym will never open, ahh Covid, and it's hot here in the summer. We're also fulltime RVers for work so space is limited but this has changed me life. I'm back to running daily again and not having to workout when it's 105 outside. I wore out my last treadmill from usage so I'm guessing to maybe get a year or so out of this depending on miles per day based on the motor size. So far its been smooth running and walking on it. Very happy that its compact and can fold away. I did leave the arms off it since they can't fold up though. I'll buy another one once this one wears out, which I'm hoping is a long time ftom now!
"I purchased this treadmill to hit my steps through the winter months. The overall product quality falls short of what I would expect for $430.00.
This treadmill is great if you don't plan on using it. It's relatively light, easy to move, and compact. However, I found the track too short and narrow. My shoes catch the outside and rear edges of the deck. I've damaged two pairs just warmup up.
The belt sounds like it's rubbing. I followed basic setup instructions, applied the suggested amount of lubrication, and still found the noise off putting enough to discourage even basic use.
I would not recommend this product. There are safer, better built options available at this price point."
I've probably bought and gave away about 4 treadmills in my lifetime. Why did I get rid of them? Because I moved a lot and they were a hassle to move. I've always lived in apartments. Between the weight of the treadmills and the size, it just added more stress to my moves. Finally! A treadmill that I will never get rid of. It's light and conveniently folds. Moving it is literally hassle free. It may not have the bells and whistles that more expensive treadmills have but it is FUNCTIONAL. It works. Good investment.
Listen... it's a pandemic. I'm cooped up... and I can't afford Nordic Trac or Peleton. I also kept seeing a version of this advertised on Instagram.... I'm not sure this is totally it. It makes a lot of noise. It did not come lubricated. I hope it doesn't break after forking over what cash I did on this. Because the track is smaller and you have to hold a remote the whole time and there is no pause button... you have to be really careful. I've nearly bit it multiple times on this thing... so I have to be REALLLLLY careful. I'm not really sure the speed, time, cals, distance really sync up. There's no way I'm speed walking at nearly 7 mi/hour. LOL. Alas... I hope I don't seriously injure myself on this. Not a ringing endorsement I know.
We've had this treadmill for a couple weeks now and, so far, we're pleased. My wife and I are brisk walkers (4 kph). We're both in our late 60s. I'm 5'9" 175 lbs and my wife is 5'2" 110 lbs. For us, the treadmill works great. It looks good in our condo. It's quiet, smooth and takes up much less space than a traditional, full size treadmill. We have a yoga mat under the treadmill to absorb vibration. We can walk on the treadmill while watching for dolphins on the Intracoastal Waterway outside our building. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is due to it's dependence on the remote. That seems like a weak link to me. We're hoping that this treadmill is durable enough to hang in there for, at least, a couple of years. Our last treadmill (Sole F63) was still running strong after five years.
"The pic is after set up.
The set up is easy - I took my friends help. I had a tough time to figure out the lock that is used to lift the handle bar. But my friend was able to figure it out quick. If you going to put the handles for holding then definitely need help is screwing it. It's easy but we did struggle to ensure the screw is going in the hole correctly. It comes with a piece to mount for your phone etc. very easy to mount and the safety clip just goes under on the magnetic tape. See the pictures on manual to figure out where the parts are located etc.
After the steps completed. It was ready to start.
Put the the plug in outlet - and was hoping for a great moment ” didn't start ( lol my outlet was faulty ” figured out after 5 mins ) put it new outlet and there you go. Started. Sigh of relief lol
It comes with a remote which is used for speed up and down and to power off and stop the treadmill.
I started slowly increasing the speed and it worked really well. Did not make much noise which was good.
Overall I was happy from receiving the product soon ( its heavy so you have stairs etc - you will need help for sure to bring it up )
Easy set up ( manual instructions could be better and easier ) but it's not a rocket science. It's really easy with help from a friend or family. Pretty easy.
Comes with 2 oil bottle ( I used little ) to be good for some time.
Overall I was happy with this product ”many bad reviews recently. But atleast for me it worked and so far I am happy. Only time will tell once I start using it daily. I will update my thoughts then."
"product looks great. compact... beginner so taking a while to get used to walk on it. and find the correct pace and go from zombie walking to more rhythmic . had someone who has used a threadmill and their walking motion like the video but said felt a slight pause they were 165 lb.
One complaint is the lever to lock lower the support is difficult to lock when support is in up position."
"I purchased this treadmill in May 2020 and the motor broke by December 2020. I'm a normal weight woman, followed all of the instructions per the manual, and only put a little over 200 miles of moderately paced walks on the machine. The treadmill never felt safe to run on because the belt was a little funky, so I only walked on it while I worked at my standing desk.
My thoughts are that the design of this treadmill has the potential to be great because it's lightweight and doesn't take up too much space. However, the major flaw is that the motors aren't built to last - especially for a treadmill that is marketed to walk on for hours at a time while you work. I was told by a mechanic who works on treadmills that the horsepower on this machine is a joke. I'd pay $500 more dollars for a machine like this if it had a motor that was even guaranteed for 3 years.
So I can't recommend purchasing this treadmill. It's definitely not worth the hassle in trying to ship it back to the company, either. If you do send the machine back for a refund like I did, I recommend picking up a bike box for free from your local bike shop if you don't have the original. Also schedule a UPS pickup on your own - they're only $5-10."
I bought this treadmill in March 2020, and I loved it. It was easy to assemble (although the place for one of the arm screws was way off and I couldn't get it in. I called one of my friends and he spent over 15 minutes - but finally got the screw in). I never had any problems, but one day when I was going through the reviews trying to find out how to lube it, I noticed a LOT of people complaining that the remote stopped working. The treadmill ONLY works by remote, so if your remote doesn't work or you lose it, you can't control the treadmill at all. I immediately reached out to the company to get info on how to order a 2nd remote (just in case). I even reached out to the company's rep, Sophia (I knew her because I write product reviews - although I paid for this treadmill). I never got an answer from either source. About a month ago, when I would point the remote at the treadmill, it was slow to respond. It could have just been the battery. However, this concerned me enough that when I got the opportunity to review another treadmill (Mobvoi), I took it, and moved the GoPlus to my garage to use as a backup. The remote control - and the fact that no one will respond - is the only reason I would not recommend this treadmill.
"*** Editing my previous comment -
They refunded $39 as after i bought the treadmill the price got reduced , so and this mark don't have any issues with the functionality of the treadmill ,
only one more thing - the calories burnt showing on treadmill is not matching my apple watch so not sure where is the discrepancy.
Rest all is as expected , hence increasing the stars **!!
Got the treadmill today , overall okay but 2 things 1) some kind of mark on the treadmill was already there as shown in the pictures and tried to capture in the video too
2) priced decreased by $39 today just saw the amazon website , they charged me more for this defective piece
As there is no contact number mentioned on there Manual , whome to contact or any email or phone number hence outing this review out there so that if they see they can contact me . Thanks !"
For the price this treadmill isn't bad. However the phone holder appears to be made for phone from 2008 because it would never hold a phone made today. Thats frustrating. The power chord is obnoxiously short to where you basically have to run right next to a wall unless you use an extension chord. It's pretty heavy and difficult to move. However for 400 bucks it will do the job. And it's very short. My husband is 6'3 and can't run on it... luckily I am very short and it's not an issue for me.
I picked this up a few months ago and it has worked out great at home. The treadmill at walking speed is really quiet. I'm comfortable running at its top speed, which was one thing I was worried about. I'd strongly advise against using a cell phone or device while using this treadmill. Twice I checked my phone and nearly fell off the narrow track. Pay attention, watch TV ahead of you, or do an activity that doesn't take your focus off your movement on the track. I do agree with other reviews that some of the assembly screws were challenging, but I eventually got things threaded and working well. So far I have recommended to my sister who plans to get one, too!
All in all it is a good machine and size but the manual bites. I loved it for a few days but today while not in use it just started making noises. Nothing in the troubleshooting guide or book anywhere. Turning it off and back on does not help just makes very loud singsong type beeping sounds. No instructions on bluetooth either. The cord is pretty short I can't imagine being close enough to the wall to plug in and still being able to have TV on but... The phone holder is not big enough to hold the Galaxy Note 10 The instructions on lubricating the belt is awful. Also I did not receive the warranty card that is referred to in the manual.
"Been using it since the lockdown due to the pandemic in my state. I hate treadmills, that being said this one has worked beautifully for me to maintain exercise while in my jail cell we call a house.
Pros:
Works well and takes up minimal footprint when folded up. Been using it for almost 6 weeks without issue although I haven't gone past 5.2 mph It has usually ran about an hour daily for those 6 weeks. No issues.
Cons:
Remote is small and there is no place to put the remote on the treadmill to contain it. Solution was to use velcro tape. Also planning on getting an infrared transmitter for my phone to copy the remote transmissions."
"EDIT - after my review company contacted me and I was able to get a new remote. I appreciated it. Couldn't get help on how to turn down volume on it but I gave them another star for contacting me
and helping out .
Pros: cheaper price, great for small spaces, easy to fold and put away (little heavy ) motor isn't very loud, iPad or iPhone holder works good. I've used it for two weeks and so far it's been working fine.
Cons: super loud beeping that you can't turn down, handle bar too far front to hold on to and if you put on the side handles you can't put down bar to store. Can only control with remote and getting an extra one is nearly impossible."
"UPDATE 3: Screw the seller and praise Amazon for providing a 100% refund, a $100 courtesy credit and the associate told me not to bother with mailing back the broken treadmill!
UPDATE 2: Seller mailed new on/off power switch without any instructions!!! The malfunctioning on/off button is wired to the treadmill and secured with a thick plastic/glue. I contacted the seller for more assistance and Amy offered to give me a ""$100 discount"" if I could find a repairman to replace the on/off switch. Well, we are in a pandemic and I cannot have anyone in my home to protect my health. Awating feedback from Amy.
UPDATE 1: The on/off button stopped working after 2 months and 1 week!!! I notified the seller and it took almost 2 weeks to receive a replacement part. I notified the seller that I would request a refund if they were unable to handle this matter properly.
ORIGINAL REVIEW: So far, so good. I found a video on YouTube to give me a better visual of the product features. Make sure you add the emergency clip prior to turning on the treadmill. I leave my treadmill unfolded. While I walk/jog I wear a fanny pack to hold the treadmill remote, TV remote and a small waterbottle. The treadmill is narrow so stay focused while you are using it.. I will update my review if I encounter any issues."
easy to assemble. Can be tucked under a desk but the legs need to be wide for it to fit fully under the desk. the treadmill makes a whining noise constantly. I thought maybe since I am 225 lbs that it was too much weight for it but when I had my 90 lb daughter run on it, it made the same loud whining noise. There is also a burning smell that started within a few hours of using the treadmill. I thought maybe it was due to me not oiling the belt enough so I bought a bottle online with a long stem to reach the entire belt. that did not work... not sure how long the treadmill will will last with the smell and noise.... sounds and smells like it will stop working soon which is a HUGE bummer!
"This is an easy to install and easy to fold treadmill. Weight and sturdiness are at the right level, not too light to wobble, not to heavy so you can move the treadmill around the room - I move it in and out from under my working desk as I work while walking but I don't do that everyday.
Total space taken is smallest you would expect, yet the width is great and it is also long enough to walk or run comfortably on the treadmill.
It is clearly very adapted for walking, I strongly recommend for that purpose. No hesitation for this if you want mainly to walk on the treadmill. However, consider this treadmill will be very good for occasional running or short running distances. If you run several times a week for very long time, you will want to purchase a treadmill that is a bit larger - sure it will take more space but it you can afford extra space and run often, take a heavier treadmill that will be more adapted.
If you are an occasional runner though, don't hesitate, take it, that treadmill will be also for you.
There is one thing I didn't appreciate: the power cord is way too short. You need to get very close to a power outlet to plug it, otherwise you will need to use a 3 prong thick extension cord. To keep it cleaner, what I decided to do is to buy another 8 feet cord and use that one instead of the original cord. The cord has a 3 prong C14 female plug on one side."
I could not give this product five stars. I do believe it is a great treadmill and it will definitely serve its purpose. However for $400 it arrived with the scratches on the screen at the bottom and the tread is shifted to the right and I cannot move it to adjust to the middle. For that amount of money I feel like it should be perfect however I do not want to replace the item because it is heavy and having to box it up and do the shipping again it's too much of a hassle. I was not given any type of credit for the damage of the item. Also if you were looking for something to incline this does not incline it is strictly for walking.
Very uncertain about this treadmill. It is compact as described, it's semi quiet (or as quiet I can expect a $500 treadmill to sound) but I'm just unsure about the longevity of it. There are a handful of reviews about the remote as it is the ONLY method to turn on and off the treadmill and adjust the speed. Keep a close eye on the remote or you may end up with a hefty piece of garbage. Secondly, it sounds like customer service is nonexistent so any support on potential issues is just shit out of luck. The counting of distance, calories and time are also inaccurate but otherwise this device works well, it serves its purpose I suppose.
OMG the instructions were clearly translated from another language and make no sense. Here is an example "Combine the Allen key and the socket wrench to a labor-saving one levers as shown in the oblique branches." What!!! Under the common failures section is "treadmill DON'T work". Two weeks and I am still not sure if I have assembled this correctly and afraid to use it. The cord is only 42 inches long so you must run a little over 3 ft from a wall.
"This treadmill is THE WORST. Save up and get a better quality one. I've had it for about 2 months and I already want to replace it. The drive belt (the internal one that makes it go, not the walking belt) is VERY LOUD. It squeaks something awful. I cracked open the housing and adjusted the drive belt, which got the treadmill to work noiselessly for about 20 minutes, then the squeaking came back with a vengeance. I can't hear myself think with the treadmill on.
In addition to the mechanical problems, it's got digital issues. The time and distance counters don't work. After walking for 30 minutes, the time counter shows 9 minutes. Same problem with the distance counter. Also, the bluetooth speaker seems to connect to things randomly. I'll be listening to something in another room when suddenly I hear an echo - it's the dang treadmill which connected itself to my device.
Lastly, not having any external controls also seems like big design flaw. If you ever lose the remote control, you're out of luck."
"Ordered GoPro received Costway treadmill instead. Little troubled but the box is in good shape and all parts were included. Does not look like it was opened before. When powered up a error code of E07 is generated. Reseated the safety harness several times. Have sent a email to support for assistance. I would like to keep this device if I can get rid of the error.
Update: Support contacted me via email . We followed their recommendations. E07 is indication that the magnetic safety harness is not connected. Turns out we had to take cover off and reattach the magnetic trigger back to the cover using duct tape. Treadmill functioning as expected."
"If you are looking for a cheap in home treadmill this is the one for you. It was easy to assemble. The only complaint I have is the drag in the belt. I found that the higher the mileage you go the less you will feel and notice the drag.
Last thing is you will need help with moving it to the location you want it to be once it is delivered. UPS dropped it off and the individual struggled to get it to my door. It wasn't until after delivery I realized they were at my door. I wished they had just rung the door bell to get some assistance. I had to drag it from my front door Into my house. It is heavy. Good thing is it wasn't damaged.
I've had it for about 2 weeks now and with the pandemic work from home period have used it every day. I am enjoying it so far."
"I received this about two weeks ago and have used it about 3 times. Why? I wanted what most customers here likely wanted - a treadmill that could easily collapse and be pushed under existing furniture, and easily taken back out. Here's why that's not true of this device:
Pros:
Easy to move the bar up and down
Easy to move across the floor
Easy to operate
Cons:
The bar ends up resting over the plastic, so if you wanted to hold on to the bar without screwing in the arms, it's difficult. Perhaps because I'm 5'10 so I'm farther away, but if I could change the design, I would give the user multiple notches to rest the bar.
The belt is a tad jerky. For someone like me who's more comfortable with my hand on something if I want to not look at my feet the entire time, it's a little nerve racking.
The arms are very difficult to attach. You have to use two screws that are provided (and very short) to screw in each arm, but I have yet to do so successfully - especially the right arm because there's a wire that seems to get in the way. I was hoping that I could either use this without the arms (not possible for me) or that the arms would be super easy to take on and off (another product design flaw). I've been trying to at least attach the left arm with a longer screw, hoping that it would be easier to assemble and at least give me one arm to hold onto, since the right arm seems to be a lost cause. However, I'll need to make a visit to the store for another type.
I'm giving this 3 stars because if I don't feel balanced using it without the arms to the point where watching TV or doing anything else is tricky, I'm not likely to use it. I would suggest creating multiple notches for the bar to rest in, so that the user can choose to only use that or attach the arms, and I would make the arms screw free so that the user can easily fold and tuck it away after use. The current design does not easily allow this, so I will likely be returning. Despite the design being sleek and it being easy to operate, the tension I feel walking without anything to hold onto is not ideal."
"Initial Thoughts:
Setup: Assembly is extremely easy and all tools needed are included. Only disappointment is the hand rails (which don't need to be put on) will prevent the treadmill from fully folding up. You can detach and reattach, but needs a screwdriver and would be time consuming. I was disappointed that the power cord is only 3ft, so unless you are putting this up against a wall with an outlet you are going to need an extension cord.
Use: It seems sturdy. I'm 6' tall and 210lbs and I felt fully supported. The narrow width didn't bother me as much as I expected it would and was easy to adjust to.
Operation: The speed and distance are in km and can not be changed to miles. It's an easy mathematical conversation so I set to 9.7 kph for my usual 6mph and felt that it was MUCH faster than I usually run, so I don't think the calibration is perfect. I adjusted down to 9kph and that seemed more accurate, but this is just based on feel.
Pros: it works and it's small.
Cons & Concerns: The phone holder doesn't seem reliable. I wouldn't trust it if you have a large phone. You can only control it by the remote, if you lose the tiny remote, or it breaks, you have a $500 room ornament.
Other: this is clear from the pictures so I'm not listing it as a con specifically but there is no place to put a drink, the remote, etc. Plan accordingly if that's a concern for you."
The treadmill is small which is great for small places but the point of it is to help you move and the band gets stuck at times. Not a fan of this product anymore. Had soo many good reviews but I should pay attention to the bad ones which where telling the truth.
"Suitable for walking or, for smaller people, fast walking. Not suitable for jogging. If you are on the heavier side, be advised that you'll need to oil the belt very well to make sure it doesn't stall or slow down while walking.
I can't explain exactly why, but the design of this treadmill's feet is terrible. If I step anywhere in the first foot of the belt, the machine tips forward and slams back down after I step back I added some exercise equipment pads and some extra rubber feet, which helps prevent this. Folding the arm down flat seems to prevent this as well, as there's enough counterweight to keep it tipping forward.
The bluetooth speaker is absolutely possessed. The pairing system isn't secure at all. It is absolutely not suitable for apartments, unless you enjoy regularly un-pairing it from your neighbor's phones. There's no easy way to prevent this from happening, unless you pop the casing open and disable it, which I *very highly* recommend that you do, albeit completely at your own risk."
"We have had this for 6 months. The remote works sometimes. When the remote doesn't work the product is useless. We tried new batteries and no luck.
Also the belt slips and you will need to adjust the two screws that control the tightness in the back more than once. It can be a bit scary if it's not tuned up because the belt will slide around. Or maybe the belt will start to drift and it will make some bad sound.
It's also annoying that the speed is dependent on arm position.
Look for a better model if you can. One that has on board controls at least."
I bought this for my office and it's fantastic. I use it 3-4x a week and it's held up well. Might do better on a hard floor, I have it on carpet so it wobbles a tiny bit. It's not that noticeable though. I'm 5'5" and have no problem with the stride. My partner is 6' tall and tried it and found walking to be just fine, jogging would make the treadmill wobble more though. Again might be better to have it on a hard floor if you're taller and jogging on it. Walking is fine on carpet. It's not terribly loud when I'm walking, I can still do video calls without issues.
This is a very basic treadmill but it gets the job done. I am 6'3 and it is just long and wide enough to accommodate my stride at 6.6 KPH. It worked right out if the box and gives you statistics on speed, distance, time and calories. It does not provide a summary of you stats at session end - would like to see that but again this is a basic treadmill.
The box arrived with one side heavily taped. I thought may be transit had some issues and they had to tape one side. After opening the box I realized packing was compromised and I seem to have received a returned treadmill. In good faith I set it up hoping it was just rather small issue. After easy assembly I started using only to realize that the belt is not moving smoothly. It stops for a half a second after every two seconds. This could be a safety issue. It is going back. Talked to Amazon customer service and they were awesome at helping me through the return process. But rather unfortunate that after so many positive reviews I would have to return this treadmill.
"This treadmill is very cheaply made. When I first pulled it out of the box, it had scratches on the handle and there was a piece of broken plastic sticking out of the connecting seal on the handle which fell inside the handle when I tried pulling it out. The whole piece including the poorly printed manual screams about its cheapness.
The machine is very heavy which gives me some hope that the motor inside it is reliable.
The speed is off by at least 1.5 mph. I am 5.2 ft; having my height and shorter legs, the machine shows that I run at 8.1 mph when I run at medium speed. On a normal treadmill at a gym it would show 6.5 mph at the max.
It is not as quiet as it is described, especially when you try running. The shock absorption is quite poor as well; my whole floor is shaking when I run on this thing, and I installed in a room corner where vibration should be partially absorbed by the building structure. Moreover, I purchased a special noise absorbing matt and a set of noise absorbing blocks. Still, my neighbor from the apartment downstairs came nocking my door several days later.
The machine came in completely dry. The instructions state that you need to lubricate it by inserting the provided bottles as far under the running strip as possible. Well, having that the bottles have very short tubes, this mission is almost impossible. I ended up cutting my hands over the edges of the running strip. I bought another bottle with a long tube which work wonderfully, but not the bottles provided with the machine.
Overall, the machine is doing what I purchased it for, that it why I give it 3 stars instead of 1."
It is great. Very easy to assemble, though feels a like a lot more than 85lbs after carrying the shipping box up 3 flights of stairs. It works perfectly. It is a no-frills treadmill. There is one hitch - the Bluetooth has zero security, anyone can connect to it and play their favorite music on it for you. So, to get rid of that, requires a lot of patience to remove several screws under the front then slide the top front of the top off to expose the speaker. Then mark, cut and cap two wires to disconnect the speaker. It still beeps and chirps for all normal functions, just no music from whoever connects to the open Bluetooth connection. You can still connect to the Bluetooth, but without the speaker it doesn't matter who connects to the Bluetooth. Other than the zero Bluetooth security, it's fantastic. If there was a password on the Bluetooth, it would be 100% perfect.
Shipping was super fast! I ordered the item on a Friday and it was delivered the next day by noon. It was amazing because it was scheduled for a Tuesday delivery!!! It is easy to put together and it's not too big and bulky it doesn't take much space! The only thing that would make this treadmill great would be the handles for the pulse!
"The treadmill works great, I only use it for when I'm working from home at my desk.
It's a bit hard to lubricate but not impossible, the picture in the instructions was crap looks like a grey and black blob.
Biggest complaint is that it came with a piece of trim cracked and busted up. Looked easy enough to replace on my own so I contacted the manufacture. They said they couldn't ship me a replacement piece if trim and offered me a $50 gift card. How can you make a product and not have parts for it? It was just cosmetic so I declined. That piece was just to flimsy in the design. Its the thickness of the cardboard on the back of a notepad and made from non-flexible plastic.
I also agree with another review i read about not having controls on the treadmill itself. Would really suck if the remote get damaged. It would render the treadmill inoperable.
But if it wasn't for the trim and instructions I would have given it 4 stars. Its worth the money for what I use it for."
So, i wasn't expecting too much with the cost of this treadmill being so low. I knew I wasn't going to run on it (and you can't really, its not long enough for running strides) but I bought it so that I could get a few extra steps in while working, taking calls, watching TV, etc. The tread is so uneven to walk on, i have to really pay attention while I'm walking so I dont trip. Im younger and in relative decent shape so I dont know if my unit is just defective or what, but I would not recommend it for someone needing any kind of walking assistance because the handrails won't do anything to help. It is easy to use, and I like the maneuverability, and yeah, it works for the basic purpose I bought it for, but dont expect anything spectacular with this purchase.
I like it. There was an issue earlier whereby UPS driver reported "Delivered" but it had not been delivered to me at all at that time. After filing a claim to UPS the item was delivered to me at my door within 90 mins of my call. Item works well so far. Important to know for planning your placement, is that the cord is fairly short & is located at the front right side of the treadmill (if you are on the treadmill). The remote to control the speed etc is ready to go. Some of the content in User's Manual requires improvement as there is some loss in translation to English. Otherwise, so far I am pleased with the product.
"This little treadmill is just that - little. At 5'2"" this is great for me and my small space. I read the reviews in advance and did not put the handrails on it, so folding it up is a snap. I had it out of the box, plugged in and synched to my cell phone for sound in under 15 minutes. The look is very clean, not the monstrosity that you'll find with most treadmills - mine is a cheery red. It's a bit heavier than it looks but I can move it if needed. It's not rugged enough to run on, but walking really fast is certainly an option. The size of the walking bed is important to note because if you have a long stride, this might be a bit short for you. My 6' tall husband has used it carefully to not walk off the back end.
Bottom line, it's perfect for me, was a great price, delivered in days and I use it about 5 days a week for 5k steps."
I was looking for a walking treadmill so I can walk during long zoom calls. This does the trick nicely! It is heavy...so isn't always the easiest to move around. But it came out of the box ready to use. Just need to remind myself it is in KM not Miles. The walking speed is a little slower than I would normally walk, but I do walk longer when meetings go for an hour+. I haven't tried the faster modes yet - when you raise the arms, you can go faster. But it works perfectly for what I bought it for. Glad I bought it for sure!
"Just got this bad boy and i'm in love! I tried it out on a quick 30 min jog at 5.5 mph - the display and controller are super easy and it was just about complete right out of the box.
It fits well under our home office couch and moved easily.
The only caveat - if the arms are on then you can't fold it down flat. I don't need the arms so it works well for me, but if you need the support and still want it to fold flat you'll need to take the arms on / off for each use. The arms are easy to attach via 2 designated slots w/ screws.
I'll review again in a few mo this (or sooner depending on how it goes)
Happy running! :)"
This is a good treadmill for walking. The design could be far better. If you want to use the arms that come with it, you can't fold it down to store it. If you don't put the arms on, it doesn't feel stable or safe. In addition, the "phone holder," won't fit any new phones. Kudos to the company though -- when I wrote them to let them know about the inadequate holder, they gave me a $15 credit. Just go into this knowing that it's good for walking. As far as storage or maneuverability, it's not good. Having to take handles on and off is not practical. And, it should clearly state that it's in km, not mph. That's annoying but I printed out a sheet for easy reference -- I found one on the internet -- it's not included with the treadmill.
The weight capacity has to be off. I'm just under 200 and this says 265 limit. That can't be accurate. The belt doesn't consistently run smooth. I have done the lubricating oil that it came with twice and I have had this for 3 weeks. The speed and distance are off. I was doing a brisk walk at 5.2 mph. Any real treadmill would have me running at that speed. I would not recommend.
It is awesome if you really need something small. I personally think is too small for my liking... if I don't pay attention, I will outside the moving area when walking. I wish the handles were easier to remove. I need the handles to walk on this treadmill, but you can't fold the machine with the handles on. It's too much trouble having to get the tool to unmount the handles and find a place to store them. Otherwise, I like this treadmill, the Bluetooth works perfectly and is very convenient.
"I've been using this treadmill a few times a week for the past 3 months. It was easy to put together myself, though it is heavy to move around. It is super slim and I am able to easily store it vertically in a small space. This was the major selling point for me. I'm a walker, though I do occasionally jog. I'm impressed at how quiet this treadmill is. It runs super smoothly and it's easy to adjust the speed with the remote.
The only thing I dislike is that you can ONLY operate this with the small remote that came with it. And the remote seems very cheap quality. I'm assuming if I lose it I'm screwed so I always immediately return it to where I store it. I removed a start due to this.
Otherwise I really love this machine. I will update if that changes."
This is a great product for a very moderately priced electric treadmill. It's reasonably lightweight and easy to move if you need to and good for the casual walker/runner. I'm an outdoor runner so it's a rainy day & winter machine for me. Nothing fancy, I don't run marathons or very fast (my 5K is 40+ minutes), I'm just a cardio adherent after a heart attack some years ago. It does not incline, which is fine with me, but might be a deal killer for those of you who want a more challenging workout.
"Like many third-party sellers on Amazon, their product photos are poorly photoshopped composites. The woman shown in the photos above is NOT on this treadmill. It doesn't come up that high and at 5'11.5"" I'm leaning over a lot. Photos are misrepresenting size.
The directions were written by someone for whom English is their fourth language. WHY don't these people hire someone to check their clarity for $200? NO instructions on how to lubricate the rollers. Having to go to youtube is ridiculous. The instructions and dark photo in their instructions are a joke.
BTW - the rollers sound like a dinosaur is running after you. If you plan on doing this while a child is sleeping, good luck. Poor value. Shouldn't have cost more than $250."
I don't recommended. I am short 5 3 and can't even do a full step Is really really really short. It has a clamp on the side to lift the arm rest that was so hard I almost broke it to be able to closed so hard. It had to close because it what secure the arms. Positive note is quite and. Because is so small can be use in a very small space.
Lets just be honest, you get what you pay for. $400 for a treadmill is pretty cheap. Are the instructions that great? Not really, however, it still really took me less then 30 mins to unpack and run. Did they give all the RIGHT parts? No, I got one flat head screw and one button screw for the phone holder. Eh? Do they even mention how to hook up the Bluetooth speaker? Nope, the instructions actually call it a horn. It would be nice if the arms attached in a different way vs. being screwed on. Just more time consuming when go to fold the arm and unscrew them every time. I actually only put in one as it was kinda difficult to slot them through both holes as necessary to install. I'll try and come back and update after we use it a few times. Just played with it a little today and seemed to work ok.
"Great little treadmill. Easy to assemble. It's small and compact so it can fit into my tiny apartment. However, it's heavy and the foldability and wheelability make it hard to move around the apartment. I don't fold it in half to put away at all. The compactness makes it so for someone a little larger it's not the most comfortable stride. I've had a bump here or there from stepping a little too far to the left or right.
Overall great for the price and compactness."
I love the simple and sturdy look of this machine. It went together rather easily, though my husband had to work repeatedly at getting the screws for one of the arms into the exact position that would result in a tight fit for the second arm. For me, the display shows plenty. At 75, and post open heart surgery, I would never run or have a need for slant or interval training ” I just want to walk steadily without needing to consider footing, traffic or unconfined dogs, etc. so this is perfect. Plan to. surge protect your investment
"I purchased this model because of all the positive reviews. When I first got it, it was perfect. Quiet and great for a low impact cardio workout during the workday.
BUT not even 2 months after purchasing, the machine started making strange grinding noises. and eventually just stopped altogether.
Mind you, I've been following the instructions and kept the track lubricated. when I wrote the company for advice (with video examples of what was happening ) they tried to help, but a language barrier limited us. Now, I have a broken treadmill taking up valuable real estate.
Very disappointed with how quickly this treadmill stopped... RUNNING."
"Considering that this treadmill is priced lower than other treadmills on Amazon, I am happy with this. There are some issues with it, but I am willing to sacrifice quality so that I can pay less. Some issues include:
-It arrived (after a month) with cracks in the plastic on the sides. I contacted their customer service team and they did not respond.
-There definitely is a drag on the belt. It is helped with lubrication and when you go faster. But it isn't a smooth walk for my 200-lb husband.
-You have to bolt the arms on, which isn't easy. You can't fold this up without the arms being removed (which means you have to keep their special shaped tool they provided).
-The phone holder has a piece of plastic on the top so if your phone doesn't fit inside the holder, you're SOL.
-I get shocked a lot on the bolts on the insides of the arms. And I have this on hardwood floor, not carpet.
Overall, as I mentioned, there definitely are issues. They are annoying, but for me it's worth it to have a halfway decent treadmill at a good price."
Great for a city apartment... however will not fit under bedcouch or couch... will fit against the wall behind the couch if the handles are removed. Speaking of the handles, you have to have fold at a 45 degree angle in order to screw them in otherwise it'll take over and hour to do.
"doesn't work and there's no way to directly contact the seller or return the machine. i'm getting E07 (the error code that means the safety chord is detached, which as you can see from picture in fact is fully and correctly attached) and there's nothing i can do now except admire this $400 waste of plastic or find my own treadmill repair person. buy
stay away."
"I've been using this for 3 weeks now at 15 miles per week of jogging
Pros:
-Fairly light weight. Two person move but can be done by one muscular person
-Virtually no assembly
-Solid feel
-Sleek design looks good in any space
-Convertible from under desk walking to full running
-Cushion deck for comfort
-Great price
Cons:
-Bar is a little wobbly but no big deal
-Ideal for smaller than average people, larger people will need a bigger treadmill"
I purchased the item to have in my office and get on it to get some steps and have something to do since I started to work from home. I find it that I need to be careful because I feel like I am going to fall sometimes. I would get used to it before venturing out and raise the speed. Users also need to get used to the length. It is not as long as your typical treadmills. I am happy with it because it is serving the purpose I purchased it for, it is fit for leisure walks or for a little heart rate elevation.
Do not buy. Attempting to return for refund. Tried to plug it in several different outlets and it blows the breaker in less than 1 minute of running. We are positive the problem is not our electrical outlets or breakers, it is the defective machine. Guess you get what you pay for.
It works, but it's really jerky when I walk on it. With the planting of each step it kind of resists for a second and causes a slight jerk to the treadmill operation. I'm dealing with it, but it's a bit odd. I have only walked on it thus far and will not be running on it due to this as I feel it might be unsafe. Also, it makes a noise occasionally that sounds like it's laboring a bit. Hopefully it gets better and doesn't go out on me.
"Cannot fold without removing the handles, and they are a pain to take off and put back on. Alignment is off a little bit due to poor machining. Also, bluetooth is ALWAYS in pairing mode and cannot be turned off. Neighbors can (and did) connect to it in the middle of the night and blast music full volume. Once someone connects you cannot connect, so if they leave their phone or bluetooth device connected you can't do anything about it and connect your own device other than power cycling and trying to beat their device reconnecting. Lastly, when power is cut the device STOPS DEAD instead of slowing. Power outages during high speed runninng running aren't great, you'll plough right through the handlebar.
Overall though this is excellent for small areas, it is dead quiet, easy to set up, looks fairly good, and isn't too hard on your joints if placed on carpet. It also has a nice integrated shield to prevent things from getting sucked under it from the end (like weights, yoga balls, etc) which is a feature I really haven't seen outside of the real expensive home units."
I bought this particular treadmill due to the weight capacity and the description box stated it weighed 50lbs. It does not, it weighs 74lbs making it harder to maneuver. The plug cord is way too short. I can't put it where I had planned because the socket wasn't close enough. The plug should be at the bottom end and not the top. Took a few mins to get the bolts into the handles due to the short length. Have to take handles back off to fold flat. Haven't tried it yet, but hope it works well.
"Just received it after waiting a week because they didn't send it out, and then turn it on and get an E05 error which means the motor isn't good. So, I sent them an email, I sent a message via their website, I sent one through Amazon, as there is no phone number, and now I have to wait AGAIN with a treadmill that doesn't work! I know many have had good experiences with this product, but mine was a lemon out of the box. I'm extremely displeased. I wanted to be able to use it today...
Update. The seller wants to give me $150 and for ME to hire someone to fix it!!! IT CAME BROKEN!!! This is unacceptable!!!"
"Things I wish had seen in a review before I ordered:
The machine came much faster than anticipated.
My remote didn't pair! I knew from research that this was the only way to turn it on. It truly does not work if the remote doesn't connect.
Costway customer service is only reachable via email and they only respond in the middle of the night. That means that we are only exchanging one email every 24 hrs. The issue has not been resolved quickly, but they are very helpful and very kind!
On the third night (third email) my contact offered to send a return label or I could wait on a new remote (which were back ordered).
On the sixth night (fifth email...there was one night they didn't respond) I received the return label.
One week after receiving the treadmill the machine was picked up by FedEx. I let my contact know it had been picked up and they refunded my purchase."
This treadmill is very well made and could fit behind my bedroom door in my small apartment. However, if you attach the arm rails then it will not fit behind the door because the rails do not fold down; that was disappointing to me because my intention was to have the rails on the treadmill, but at the same time I did want my treadmill sitting out in the middle of my apartment. I returned the treadmill because I did not realize that it did not have the capability of inclining for a better workout. After one hour on the treadmill, I would only burn about 90 calories as opposed to a treadmill in a gym that includes the incline feature, I could burn 500 calories. Overall though it is a good treadmill, but I needed a more productive workout.
"I got this for the household restlessness and winter isolation. The product was deliver early so bonus. Was easy to assemble and was able to get on and get going within 10 min. Not heavy I can move it easily. Folds nicely under my couch so great for small spaces and not an eye sore. I have used is daily for about a month and have found it quiet as it say. No extras just basic needs.
Some cons. When walking the belt will stick slightly (only when walking) goes away at high speeds so not a huge issue. And if you lose the remote you cannot use the treadmill so get a piece of Velcro and stick that sucker on."
I really like this treadmill but in my personal opinion it's got some design flaws. It comes with a remote that gets it going which is okay but if you lose that remote you're screwed until a replacement comes. The phone holder is okay as well but my phone is a bit to big for it, so no iPhone plus, iPad, or other tablets unless you put it on a table or something like it next to you.. and lastly the cord is to short.. for the "portability" of this treadmill you can't really put this thing in the middle of the room to watch tv, it would have to be right by a plug. Aside from these minor flaws, it isn't a bad treadmill. I've used it for about 2 months and am pretty pleased with the performance.
"At the gym treadmills show I usually run 6.4 but this machine I had to put on 10. Not sure why such a big difference in the speed rating . Overall after running my first 1h run it did a good job. I was looking for something small and that would look good and be a decent quality.
Ordered dark green and come black. It is ok I don't really mind black."
The product came yesterday and already it broke. The belt continues to drift to the left no matter how many times I fix it. There is a giant crease in the belt that makes a squeaking noise every time it rotates through the machine (yes, I tried to oil and it tighten/ loosen the belt). Then, as of 2 hours ago, the machine is making a terrible loud constant squeak because the belt keeps drifting and is getting caught under the side of the machine. Total piece of crap and now I Have to return it. Definitely do not recommend
I have only been using the treadmill desk for a few days, but so far it is working great. The set up was pretty straightforward. I find it pretty easy to walk and work on my computer. There is some noise that might be heard over a video call maybe but it's not too bad. Just the sound of the walking surface moving and my steps. Not at all as loud as gym treadmills. It's pretty heavy so I don't see myself moving it at all. Wish there was a pause button - the distance tracker restarts every time I stop the treadmill. I got this to help with back pain from sitting all day, so I will have to wait and see if it helps. I think all in all, the product is worth the money and is true to the description!
"Missing key parts to use the machine!
No remote was included so the treadmill won't work."
It does not move smoothly. Even after oiling it it sticks and it seems like the belt is crooked. I want to return it.
I can't recommend this treadmill enough. I've been sedentary for months and months since I went back to being a SAHM (stay at home mom). My boys are toddlers and it's an adventure getting them down three flights of stairs just to go outside and worry about them running into a busy road and parking lot. Not much space to play at our rental complex so we make due with what we have. This treadmill got me up and moving when all I wanted to do was go for a walk and no worry about the kids! I don't have to leave my apartment and it's super quiet and stores right under our queen sized bed. Love it.
"This treadmill is useless. The belt skips. In order to use it you have to push with your feet. I did tighten the belt and use the oil. I did contact the seller and let them know the steps I took and they wrote me back to tell me to do what I had already done. I dont think they understand English and send a standard reply.
Im stuck with a treadmill that doesnt work correctly. H"
Item came damaged. Box destroyed. Screws not working or fitting ... will be filling a return.
Finally I received the package with so much delay. Upon opening the box, I noticed that a part of one of the edges was broken. I unpacked the item. I didn't see the broken pieces in the box. It means that it was broken even before packing and shipping to me. I assembled the phonebracket and the safety lock. But couldn't install the handlebars. They didn't fit correctly. But the big disaster was when the treadmill didn't turn on at all. I thought maybe I should turn it on using the remote control. This was wrong too. Now I am stuck with a big piece of garbage that doesn't work. I cannot return it because it is too heavy to be put back in the box, and packed, and shipped. A total wastage of time and money. Not recommended at all.
What drew me to this treadmill was that it could be folded down and stored under a bed or couch. And it delivers! I did have to adjust the belt tightness when it first arrived, but once I did that and started using it a bit, it loosened up and now feels smooth. When I first tried it, it was very jerky. I've been using it almost every day for the last couple weeks and am in love! The only down side is that the calories displayed don't seem right (they don't match my fitness tracker) and the distance is in KM instead of miles. But I think this is the perfect little machine for the price!
Wouldn't recommend this treadmill as it operates with a remote only. When the remote breaks or you lose it, it is not replaceable and you are stuck with a treadmill that can only be turned on and not controlled. I had to return the treadmill because it arrived defective (latch was stuck) and upon requesting a return and refund they told me I needed to send a video of the damage. The item was already back in the box so I did not submit a video and I had to take this to a UPS store to return it. This was an inconvenience. Would not recommend.
Let me start by saying the treadmill is functional and does it's job. BUT BEWARE THIS PRODUCT IS POORLY ASSEMBLED AT THE FACTORY! Main complaint is Quality Control (QC) of the product overall. It wasn't assembled correctly and it somehow passed the company's QC. I could not install one of the side bars that is parallel to the floor because the holes that were drilled for the bolts were not drilled properly and were not checked in QC to see if the bolts fit through. Every time I look at it I get irritated for purchasing it.
The treadmill itself is great for the money. It is hard to move around and it's not compact. You have to remove the arms each time if your going to slide it under furniture. I leave mine up in my living room which does take up space. Next time I'll invest in one more portable that will fold up against the wall and one that has a bigger motor. But for the money, it's a great buy.
This is my first treadmill purchase ever and I'm very pleased. It's a great size for any small space and was a cinch to assemble. I wish the phone holder would hold my phone vertical, because with it horizontal it presses in buttons to activate Siri when you first put it in the holder. It would also be nice if they'd integrated a remote holder, but no biggie - I took small Velcro circles and attached it that way. Make sure you lubricate the belt before your first use - it's easy to do with the included bottles.
"It works good, but it's not though through of how to quickly convert it from working under the desk to a stand free mode. You have to use a tool to remove handles in order to fold it to work under the desk. Plus the lock is very hard to open/close.
The surface is only good when you step size is small. For fast walking it is definitely not for those people who has long legs :D."
"Hi. After opening the product we discovered there was a fatal flaw in its design - if you put any weight on it the belt stopped moving. Obviously, you can use a treadmill if you can't walk on it (I'm 170 pounds - well below its limit).
Per the instructions I tried loosening/tightening the belt and added lube. Since none of that worked I tried contacting the company per their paperwork (""Contact our friend customer service department for help first. Replacements for missing or damaged parts will be shipped ASAP.!"") Their first 4 responses were all within 24 hours:
1 - ""Verify the purchase information""
2 - ""Try fixing it via the steps you already tried""
3 - ""Can you hire a repair technician to fix it? We'll cover $100. Or we can give you a return label and refund your money.""
4 - ""We'll send you a return label - let us know after you return it and we'll refund you. Or, if you want to keep it and fix it locally we'll refund you $200.""
I hadn't been able to find anyone that could do the repair under $100, but one of them could do it under $200 so I scheduled the repair.
The technician comes out, opens up the treadmill, pokes around, and is like, ""Oh, here's your problem - they never installed the 2 bolts here that create tension on the motor."" He didn't have matching bolts so I emailed the company with the bolt info asking for the parts and for the offer to refund $200 to cover the cost of the repair. I emailed six times over the last 9 days with no response.
So yeah, the treadmill is easy to fold, and it's great for small spaces. It's also just a 75 pound piece of art that costs not only the monetary price you'll pay but also for the repairs and time spent trying to repair it."
"It is super quiet but the handles need to be screwed in that defeats the purpose of folding treadmill. Also without the fob you can't control the treadmill which is a bad idea as well as it doesn't connect to anything so where do I put it. The main bar cannot be adjusted it sits that far back. Sending it back is going to cost me$65.00 I tried to cancel about 30 after I ordered it which was impossible because I thought it was going to have some issues after reading a review from another customer to late. This has a lot of issues. The handles, fob, main bar, a be good thing is it's super quiet also when adjusting the speed the beeping is loud. I should have never ordered this. Really disappointed in this entire process & product. So UPDATE DONT BUY IF U NEED TO SEND IT BACK ITS EXPENSIVE & SUPER HEAVY TO GET BACKIN THE BOX! DONT BUY DONT BUY DONT BUY DONT BUY DONT BUY!!!
Another update it sticks when walking also it's slow!! If you're a walker you will be frustrated!!! I'm tall so it's extra frustrating. Using only the fab & no controls on the treadmill is a real Pain in the Ass."
Bought as a replacement for a larger treadmill that broke. It has the capacity for running and walking speeds. Arms must be up for running but can be lowered to place under a desk or table to use while working or other activity. Has no attached desk area for a laptop or book but does have a phone holder and a slot that will hold an iPad. It is quiet. Feels flimsy compared to the old treadmill but really is great for both me and my husband walking. My daughter has used it and likes it too. No frills, no incline but does the job for us.
Wanted to love this. It is not sturdy at all. The belt kept slipping. Oiled it and tightened it. Still did not work out. Contacted the seller. They were very helpful. Gave further instructions. But we had already done all of that. It's very small. My wife is 4'11 and still felt that it was too small.
The Treadmill is a nice small lightweight treadmill. The blue is a nice sleek color.
Mine arrived damaged and the seller was kind enough to give a partial refund to an amount we agreed was sufficient. This treadmill is very small but it works. It is a bit frustrating you cannot fold it up with the armrest things attached. And they're not exactly quick and easy to get off and on. I'm pretty disappointed by that because it is the main reason we got it. But, for the price, I guess I can deal with it. Expect a mediocre, cheap treadmill that works ok and you wont be dissapointed.
"This treadmill has worked great so far, smooth and quiet. The arm does swing up easily but attaching the little arms is not easy on and off so I don't use them. I actually just leave it flat to use.
It is not as easy to move around as I would have liked. There are wheels on one end only and it is heavy. The wheels work well and it's smooth but it is too unwieldy to try to get it under the couch, so I don't.
The directions are hilarious! Fortunately it doesn't need a lot of instructions."
This thing was ok while it lasted, but 7 months in it is making horrible noises. We have tried oiling it and adjusting it to no avail. No response from support.
"I have been using this treadmill for a couple of days now and I find it really easy to use.
The set up for the treadmill was very easy and I didn't require instructions, probably because I chose the without expert assembly. The treadmill is foldable, so it doesn't take too much space in my house. When I'm exercising I love to listen to music, so the Bluetooth speaker was an awesome installation."
I needed a small, easy fold up treadmill. I went with the Go Plus because of the price & shipping cost to Alaska. I read the reviews and was a bit nervous due to a couple of negative ones, but I must say I am quite impressed with this treadmill. It was easy to assemble, no problems with belt noise when used properly (it will have a slight squeak sound if you don't stay paced with the speed you set it on) and it folds up easily. I am very happy with my purchase.
Doesn't have all that much power. Even when pushed to max speed, the belt feels like it's sputtering. The form is fine, and in a pinch and/or with a standing table, it's good. But if you want this as an alternative to, say, walking outdoors or going on a reg sized treadmill...it's not that great.
Best COViD-19 trainer, boredom buster, trying to stay active buddy. However, the arms are poorly designed. Why don't they fold in so you can fold the whole thing down when you want to store it? I ended up not attached the arms. I hang on to the unlocked cross bar instead. It's pretty small and took a while until I didn't fall off sideways. But my situation may be different as I just had my knee replaced. The motor and tread seem like good quality and that's what is important really. The remote works alright but had some problem installing the battery due to a misaligned spring. It was missing one screw for the phone support, which was too small for my IPad anyway. My husband found a screw to fix it. Don't drop the remote into the treadmill or you will need help to get it out! Velcro it somewhere, okay?
BEWARE - this treadmill will not work with standard wall outlets!! And despite getting approved for a return the seller has not refunded me even though tracking code shows they received my refurn 2 weeks ago. Although it doesn't say it anywhere in the item description it needs a special outlet like a heavy duty appliance, only figured this out after blowing a fuse. Unclear if I'll ever get my money back. Super disappointing.
So, I'm giving this a solid 4 stars because it's a great walking/light running treadmill that is easy to assemble, store under a bed (or in a closet standing up) and pull out when the weather isn't making it easy to go outside. Between natural and human induced disasters messing up the air, dealing with people who don't believe in wearing a mask to prevent the spread of what have you”and wanting to stay inside somedays...this treadmill really rises to the occasion when you need it most. It's no frills and pretty basic. The counter/screen on the unit feels a bit pointless, as the readings I get from my smartwatch vs. the machine are significantly different. I trust my smart watch more for accuracy, so a solid 4 stars. Would buy & recommend.
Error code E07, checked magnetic safety lock numerous times . Unit will not operate. Left message with customer service. Will update with response time and follow up. Costway emailed me back and asked me to try a refrigerator magnet to verify bad safety key. No luck. Safety key is not the issue. E07 still persists.Now they are asking me to check the wiring connections in the unit. Will update.
Stopped working. Bought it Sept 20th. Died suddenly yesterday Feb. 7. That's a six month lifespan. Buy at your own risk. Won't last and you'll have a piece of equipment that just sits there and collects dust under your bed just because it's foldable.
I use it for walking while working from home and it works fine for that. It is NOT easy to fold unless you use it without the arms. The arms are screwed in and require tools to install and remove. Also, if you attach the phone holder, it will be two inches off the floor with nothing supporting it when folded. It took me less than a week to step on it and break it off. The display is in km, with no way that I could find to change it. Not a big deal, just means more clicks on the + on the remote to get it up to speed (while working, I have it set to 3.2 km/hr = 2 mph). I've tried running on it once, and it was ok. Certainly not comparable to a more expensive model though.
VERY DISSAPOINTED!! treadmill did not allow me to go past 4mph to jog on it. Contacted customer support and they emailed me a list of possible causes and suggested I try to fix it myself. I wish they would have tested it before sending it to me. The company was great at issuing my refund. Very inconvenient to return a large product like that. But very happy I got it returned with no cat fight involved. I really LOVED the sleekness and compact of the treadmill. I ordered the red and it was very beautiful color. I only wish it would have worked as advertised. Was scared to re order another one and have the same issue.
This treadmill has been a godsend! I've been using it a few times a week for about two months. I am 5'5 and 130lb and have no problem running on this comfortably. I was worried about the pad size, but it feels solid. My husband who is 6' and 200lb uses it for brisk walks. The size is perfect for my small home office and I can collapse the handle so it doesn't show in video conf calls. I didn't instal the two side arms because it won't collapse with them on, but haven't missed them. The small phone holder is useful. I don't use the provided speaker because i prefer my Bluetooth speaker, but otherwise it has decent sound quality. It has a short cord so defiantly need an extension. Love it!
"The treadmill was delivered broken a piece ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥². I was so excited to try it and it made me sad a little. I decided to just suck it up and use it anyway because I dont think this broken piece can affect the functionality of the treadmill and all that hassle or returning and replacing with a new one (could possibly be broken again) is just tiresome.
The instruction was ok it could have been better if they list the instruction in an ordered list format instead of a long essay explaining step by step.
This can get noisy and it is quite heavy to move so be aware if you have stairs at home and you want to move it up or down stairs."
"BLUF: Affordable, foldable treadmill that works great for someone with limited space and who mainly wants to use it to walk.
This treadmill works great for my small space. I'm short (4'11) so I don't have issues with the stride length. I mainly use it for walking/jogging but can do short runs on the max speed. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who wants to mostly run on it since it's max speed is 12 kph. My boyfriend is 5'8 and can still use it but feels restricted due to stride length."
I am loving this treadmill. It's remarkably nice for the size. I am a walker and it's perfect. I can lean it up against the wall when not in use, and pretty easily move it and unfold it to use it. I was worried the belt would be too small but it is just fine. I feel confident walking on it with plenty of room for my stride. I love that it takes up such a little amount of space, works well, and is quiet. Very happy with my purchase.
Zero stars. The machine doesn't work right out of the box. Everything seems fine except for the remote control which doesn't light up. The remote control is not working. I changed the battery, and it still doesn't work.
This has worked tremendously for me. They provide you with two, small bottles of lubrication oil and that needs to be used occasionally when the treadmill starts making any noise. That clears it up right away. I walk on this every day at my standing desk for work, sometimes miles and miles. It makes a loud beep sound when you first turn it on, but the treadmill itself is nice and quiet. The Bluetooth speakers are as good as they can be expected. It is heavier to maneuver but it does have wheels. Highly recommend and have shared with coworkers
I do not recommend purchasing this treadmill. I have used it a few times now and the machine started smoking/burning inside the machine and almost caught on fire. The machine will not even turn on. I can not get ahold of the seller for a refund or a replacement for this defective/unsafe product. I am at a loss for $450. I recommend ordering from a seller who backs their products.
Exactly What I was looking for! So far so good, just got this. Was delivered earlier and packaged really well. The only reason it didn't get five stars is that there is a big bump on the tread that keeps making a Little sound and makes it a little uneven. But not enough to be a problem. Still loving it. Fits under my tiny home desk and my couch. Goes pretty fast actually if you want it to. Haven't found the max speed yet. Great for not gaining that Covid 30.
The item did not work. It worked without a human on it but as soon as I stepped it would stop and start and stop and start, which was super unsafe. Definitely not worth the money and hopefully will receive a refund for the product.
Super easy to set up, super compact which is necessary for my small space and it's pretty quiet in comparison to other treadmills I've used. Really do love this gadget. Keeping me fit and healthy during the shelter at home mandate. For reference I am 5'4 112 pounds, it doesn't make much noise when I run on it. Just a little hum. As someone who's owned two other treadmills in her life, this one is great quality for the price and convenience.
I'm really loving this treadmill. I have no issues with walking or jogging or running. It seems sturdier than I thought for the price. My favorite feature is that it folds flat and I can tuck it out of the way. My only complaint is that you can't install the arms and shelf if you want it to keep folding flat after every use. Also, I'd love if there were a cover that fit this guy in its folded (flat) position
I bought this after reading the majority of reviews. I purchased it and for the first two months was very pleased with it. I lifted it up on blocks to "lube" the running belt. Made sure that it was level across the width of the treadmill and then that all points front to back were level too. Walked and then ran on it one time. Now all the belt does is slip to the right. What a piece of crap! Sought help, but to no avail. Do not buy this treadmill. It will only disappoint you in the long run (sorry about the pun). The company and then product is not worth it.
This is such a good idea only it's false advertisement. I am 215# and it's rated for 260# but when I first set it up and got on the side rails, the side broke. Now the should have been quiet treadmill is squealing annoyingly. I tried to contact the seller to get help with this but that's been a lost cause. Its really big for a return and I'm not sure how I'll work around that, but I feel like they should compensate for a faulty item.
